#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Early and late universe holographic cosmology from a new generalized  entropy**
 - **Authors:** Shin'ichi Nojiri, Sergei D. Odintsov, Tanmoy Paul
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08876)
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new four-parameter entropy function that generalizes the Tsallis, R\'{e}nyi, Barrow, Sharma-Mittal, Kaniadakis and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies for suitable limits of the parameters. Consequently, we address the early and late universe cosmology corresponding to the proposed four-parameter entropy function. As a result, it turns out that the entropic cosmology from the generalized entropy function can unify the early inflation to the late dark energy era of the universe. In such a unified scenario, we find that -- (1) the inflation era is described by a quasi de-Sitter evolution of the Hubble parameter, which has an exit at around 58 e-folding number, (2) the inflationary observable quantities like the spectral index for primordial scalar perturbation and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are simultaneously compatible with the recent Planck data, and (3) regarding the late time cosmology, the dark energy EoS parameter is found to be consistent with the Planck result for the same values of the entropy parameters that lead to the viable inflation during the early universe. Furthermore, we show that the entropic cosmology from the proposed entropy function is equivalent to holographic cosmology, where the respective holographic cut-offs are determined in terms of either particle horizon and its derivative or future horizon and its derivative.

#### **A Simple Model for Quantum Gravity: the one-dimensional case**
 - **Authors:** Ricardo Paszko
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08496)
 - **Abstract**
 Group theory is used to construct a model for quantum gravity and exact results are obtained in one dimension. Comparison with Regge calculus shows that the results agree in the strong cosmological constant limit for an open curve. In the closed case, the average edge length has a minimum value and this give us a clue for higher dimensions.

#### **$T\bar{T}$ in JT Gravity and BF Gauge Theory**
 - **Authors:** Stephen Ebert, Christian Ferko, Hao-Yu Sun, Zhengdi Sun
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07817](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07817)
 - **Abstract**
 JT gravity has a first-order formulation as a two-dimensional BF theory, which can be viewed as the dimensional reduction of the Chern-Simons description of 3d gravity. We consider $T\bar{T}$-type deformations of the $(0+1)$-dimensional dual to this $2d$ BF theory and interpret the deformation as a modification of the BF theory boundary conditions. The fundamental observables in this deformed BF theory, and in its $3d$ Chern-Simons lift, are Wilson lines and loops. In the $3d$ Chern-Simons setting, we study modifications to correlators involving boundary-anchored Wilson lines which are induced by a $T\bar{T}$ deformation on the $2d$ boundary; results are presented at both the classical level (using modified boundary conditions) and the quantum-mechanical level (using conformal perturbation theory). Finally, we calculate the analogous deformed Wilson line correlators in $2d$ BF theory below the Hagedorn temperature where the principal series dominates over the discrete series.
