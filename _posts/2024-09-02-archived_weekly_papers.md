#### **Title:
          Static Planck stars from effective loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Edward Wilson-Ewing

 - **Abstract**
 Effective loop quantum gravity dynamics are derived for spherically symmetric spacetimes with a perfect fluid matter content. For homogeneous spacetimes, the effective dynamics agree with the standard results of loop quantum cosmology, while the equations for static solutions give an effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. There exist solutions to the effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation that have a mass of the order of the Planck mass, a Planckian radius, and no horizon; these miniature stars could potentially contribute to dark matter, and could be an end state for an evaporating black hole.
