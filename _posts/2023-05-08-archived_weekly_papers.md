 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the multipartite entanglement of a uniformly curved quantum 3D space region with boundary, realised in terms of spin networks defined on a graph with non trivial SU(2) holonomies, in the framework of loop quantum gravity. The presence of intrinsic curvature in the region is encoded in closure (topological) defects associated with tag-spins attached to the vertices of the graph. For such states, we generalise the bulk-to-boundary mapping as to include the space of tags in an extended boundary space: bulk information is shared among generically entangled boundary surfaces and intrinsic curvature degrees of freedom. We model the quantum region on a tripartite system composed by two (complementary) boundary subregions and the set of bulk tags. Via replica techniques, we can compute the typical value of the logarithmic negativity of the reduced boundary, described as an open quantum system, in a large spin regime. We find three entanglement regimes, depending on the ratio between the number of tags (curvature) and the area of the dual surface at the boundary. These are well described by the generalised Page curve of a tripartite random state. In particular, we find area scaling behaviour for negativity in case of small curvature, while for large curvature the negativity vanishes, suggesting an effective thermalization of the boundary. Remarkably, the PPT character of the mixed boundary state corresponds to a change in the effective topology of the network, with the two boundary subregions becoming disconnected.

#### **Massless KG-oscillators in Som-Raychaudhuri cosmic string spacetime in a  fine tuned rainbow gravity**
 - **Authors:** Omar Mustafa
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02203](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02203)
 - **Abstract**
 A fine tuned rainbow gravity describes both relativistic quantum particles and anti-particles alike. That is, the ratio $y=E/E_{P}$ in the rainbow functions $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) $ and $% g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) $ should be fine tuned into $0\leq y=E/E_{P}\leq 1\Rightarrow y=\left\vert E\right\vert /E_{P}$, otherwise rainbow gravity will only secure Planck's energy scale $E_p$ invariance for relativistic particles and the anti-particles are left unfortunate (in the sense that their energies will be indefinitely unbounded). Using this fine tuning we discuss the rainbow gravity effect on Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in Som-Raychaudhuri cosmic string rainbow gravity spacetime background. We use the rainbow functions: (i) $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =1$, $% g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =\sqrt{1-\epsilon y^{n}}, n=0,1$, loop quantum gravity motivated pairs, (ii) $% g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =\left( 1-\epsilon y\right) ^{-1}$, a horizon problem motivated pair, and (iii) $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =\left( e^{\epsilon y}-1\right) /\epsilon y$, $g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =1$, a gamma-ray bursts motivated pair. We show that the energies obtained using the first two rainbow functions in (i) completely comply with the rainbow gravity model (on the invariance of the Planck's energy scale $E_{p}$). The rainbow function pair in (ii) has no effect on massless KG-oscillators. Whereas, the one in (iii) does not show any eminent tendency towards the invariance of the Planck's energy scale. Yet, we suggest a new rainbow function pair $(g_0(y)=(1-\epsilon y)^{-1}, g_1 (y)=1)$, and show that it secures invariance of the Planck's energy scale $E_p$. Moreover, similar performance is observed when this new pair is used for KG-oscillators and KG-Coulombic particles in cosmic string rainbow gravity spacetime and magnetic fields.
