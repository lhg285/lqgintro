#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Fundamental length scale and the bending of light in a gravitational  field**
 - **Authors:** Philip Tee, Nosratollah Jafari
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05063](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05063)
 - **Abstract**
 The canonical approach to quantizing quantum gravity is understood to suffer from pathological non-renomalizability. Nevertheless in the context of effective field theory, a viable perturbative approach to calculating elementary processes is possible. Some non-perturbative approaches, most notably loop quantum gravity and combinatorial quantum gravity imply the existence of a minimal length. To circumvent the seeming contradiction between the existence of a minimum length and the principle of special relativity, Double Special Relativity introduces modified dispersion relationships that reconcile the conflict. In this work, we combine these dispersion relationships with an effective field theory approach to compute the first post Newtonian correction to the bending of light by a massive object. The calculation offers the prospect of a directly measurable effect that rests upon both the existence of a quantized gravitational field and a minimal length. Experimental verification would provide evidence of the existence of a quantum theory of gravity, and the fundamental quantization of spacetime with a bound on the minimal distance.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The space of solutions of the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh effective black hole  model**
 - **Authors:** Beatriz Elizaga Navascués, Alejandro García-Quismondo, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04677](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04677)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider a general choice of integration constants in the resolution of the dynamical equations derived from a recently proposed effective model that describes black hole spacetimes in the context of loop quantum cosmology. The interest of our analysis is twofold. On the one hand, it allows for a study of the entire space of solutions of the model, which is absent in the literature and is fundamental for understanding the relation with any underlying quantum theory. On the other hand, choices of integration constants that generalize the type of solutions considered so far may lead to exotic behaviors in the effective black hole geometry, as well as modified thermodynamical properties. With these motivations in mind, we discuss the interior and exterior geometries, and present the conditions that a satisfactory matching at the horizons imposes. Then, we turn our attention to the Hawking temperature associated with the black horizon of the model, which we find to be affected by the freedom of choice of integration constants. Finally, we briefly comment on the asymptotic structure of the general solution and compare different notions of mass. 

#### **Two-time alternative to the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh black hole interior**
 - **Authors:** Alejandro García-Quismondo, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04720)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the viability of a recently proposed generalization of the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh spacetime for the effective description of the interior region of a Schwarzschild black hole within the framework of loop quantum cosmology. The approach is based on a choice of polymerization parameters that is more general than the ones previously considered in the literature and that results in the natural appearance of two times to describe the solutions. If one is interested in examining the physics derived from this model, it is fundamental to ensure that one can attain a well-defined effective geometry in the whole region under consideration, in particular as regards the redundancy of the two times, which one needs to express in terms of a single time coordinate. In order to determine whether this requirement is met, we analyze the definition of these times and their relation. We show that one can reach an acceptable interior spacetime geometry by exploiting the freedom to define the origins of the two times independently.

#### **On the Possible Spacetime Structures of Rotating Loop Quantum Black  Holes**
 - **Authors:** Che-Yu Chen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03797](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03797)
 - **Abstract**
 To date, a mathematically consistent construction of effective rotating black hole models in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is still lacking. In this work, we start with the assumption that rotating LQG black hole metrics can be effectively obtained using Newman-Janis Algorithm. Then, based on a few extra fair assumptions on the seed metric functions, we make a conjecture on what a rotating LQG black hole would generically look like. Our general arguments and conclusions can be supported by some known specific examples in the literature.
