 - **Abstract**
 DeWitt's suggestion that the wave function of the universe should vanish at the classical big-bang singularity is here considered within the framework of one-loop quantum cosmology. For pure gravity at one loop about a flat four-dimensional background bounded by a 3-sphere, three choices of boundary conditions are considered: vanishing of the linearized magnetic curvature when only transverse-traceless gravitational modes are quantized; a one-parameter family of mixed boundary conditions for gravitational and ghost modes; diffeomorphism invariant boundary conditions for metric perturbations and ghost modes. A positive zeta(0) value in these cases ensures that, when the 3-sphere boundary approaches zero, the resulting one-loop wave function approaches zero. This property may be interpreted by saying that, in the limit of small three-geometry, the resulting one-loop wave function describes a singularity-free universe. This property holds for one-loop functional integrals, which are not necessarily equivalent to solutions of the quantum constraint equations.

#### **Wilson-line Scalar Mass in Flux Compactification on an Orbifold  $T^2/Z_2$**
 - **Authors:** Nobuhito Maru, Hiroki Tanaka
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01747)
 - **Abstract**
 In a torus compactification with magnetic flux, the scalar field generated from the higher dimensional gauge field becomes the Nambu-Goldstone boson of the translational symmetry in extra spaces and the mass of the scalar field is not allowed. In this paper, we explicitly show that the one-loop quantum correction to the mass of the scalar field is generated at fixed points in a case of an orbifold compactification $T^2/Z_2$ with magnetic flux. This is because the scalar field is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson as a result of explicit breaking of the translational symmetry by the fixed points. This result might be possible to shed a new light on the solution of the hierarchy problem.
