#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Loop Quantum Gravity motivated multihorizon rotating black holes**
 - **Authors:** Jitendra Kumar, Shafqat Ul Islam, Sushant~G.~Ghosh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13562](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13562)
 - **Abstract**
 With a semiclassical polymerization in the loop quantum gravity (LQG), the interior of Schwarzschild black holes provides a captivating single-horizon regular black hole spacetime. The shortage of rotating black hole models in loop quantum gravity (LQG) substantially restrains the progress of testing LQG from observations. Motivated by this, starting with a spherical LQG black hole as a seed metric, we construct a rotating spacetime using the revised Newman-Janis algorithm, namely, the LQG-motivated rotating black holes (LMRBH), which encompasses Kerr ($l=0$) black holes as an exceptional case. We discover that for any random $l>0$, unlike Kerr black hole, an extremal LMRBH refers to a black hole with angular momentum $a>M$. The rotating metric, in parameter space, describes (1) black holes with an event and Cauchy horizons, (2) black holes with three horizons, (3) black holes with only one horizon or (4) no horizon spacetime. We also discuss the horizon and global structure of the LMRBH spacetimes and its dependence on $l/M$ that exhibits rich spacetime structures in the ($M,\;a,\;l$) parameter space.

#### **The topological entanglement entropy of black holes in loop quantum  gravity**
 - **Authors:** Jingbo Wang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12455)
 - **Abstract**
 Topological order (long-range entanglement) play important role in modern condensed matter physics. In this paper, we will show that the four dimensional black hole can also have topological order, by showing that the topological entanglement entropy is non-zero. The properties of the topological order show that the large diffeomorphisms will act as symmetry (not gauge) transformation on the physical states. More importantly, the long-range entanglement will make the Hawking radiation pure. 

#### **Tests of Loop Quantum Gravity from the EHT Results of Sgr A$^*$**
 - **Authors:** Misba Afrin, Sushant G. Ghosh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12584)
 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration's image of the compact object at the galactic centre is the first direct evidence of the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$. The shadow of Sgr A$^*$ has an angular diameter $d_{sh}= 48.7 \pm 7\,\mu$as with fractional deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole shadow diameter $\delta= -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\,,-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ (for the VLTI and Keck mass-to-distance ratios). Sgr A$^*$'s shadow size is within $~10\%$ of the Kerr predictions, equipping us with yet another tool to analyse the gravity in the strong-field regime, including testing loop quantum gravity (LQG). We use Sgr A$^*$'s shadow to constrain the metrics of two well-motivated LQG-inspired rotating black holes (LIRBHs) models characterized by an additional deviation parameter $L_q$, which recover the Kerr spacetime in the absence of quantum effects ($L_q \to 0$). We use the astrophysical observables shadow area $A$ and oblateness $D$ to estimate the black hole parameters. When increasing the size of the quantum effects through $L_q$, the black hole shadow size increases monotonically, while the shape gets more distorted, allowing us to constrain the fundamental parameter $L_q$. While the EHT observational results completely rule out the wormhole region in the second LIRBH, a substantial parameter region of the generic black holes in both models agree with the EHT results. We find upper bounds on $L_q$ from the shadow of Sgr A$^*$: $L_q \lesssim 0.0423$ and $L_q \lesssim 0.0821$ for the two LIRBHs respectively, both more stringent than those obtained with the EHT image of M87$^*$.
