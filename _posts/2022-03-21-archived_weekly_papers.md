#### **The Immirzi field in modified gravity: superentropic black holes with  scalar hair**
 - **Authors:** Simon Boudet
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of f(R) generalizations to the Holst action, endowed with a dynamical Immirzi field, we derive an analytic solution describing asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes with hyperbolic horizon. These exhibit a scalar hair of the second kind which ultimately depends on the Immirzi field radial behaviour. In particular, we show how the Immirzi field modifies the usual entropy law associated to the black hole. We also verify that the Immirzi field boils down to a constant value in the asymptotic region, thus restoring the standard loop quantum gravity picture. We finally prove the violation of the reverse isoperimetric inequality, resulting in the superentropic nature of the black hole, and we discuss in detail the thermodynamic stability of the solution.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Comment on "Towards a quantum notion of covariance in spherically  symmetric loop quantum gravity"**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06049)
 - **Abstract**
 A recent paper promises new constructions that may make it possible to achieve covariance in spherically symmetric models of loop quantum gravity. This claim is contrary to the discovery of several stubborn obstacles to covariance uncovered in the same models during the last few years. As the authors point out in their abstract, new progress is supposedly possible if one takes into account crucial features of a certain partial Abelianization of the gauge transformations of spherically symmetric gravity, published by the same authors. In canonical form, these gauge transformations are given by hypersurface deformations. A closer inspection of the technical calculations shows that spherically symmetric hypersurface deformations are, in fact, violated in the construction.
