#### **Semi-classical rotating black hole in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Zhaoyi Xu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14183](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14183)
 - **Abstract**
 In the research paper [1], the analytical solution of semi-classical rotating black holes (BH) in loop quantum gravity theory (LQG) is obtained, but an unknown function $H$ is still preserved. In this note, we obtain an expression for the unknown function $H$, which makes the space-time line element of the semi-classical rotating BH in the LQG theory sufficiently well-expressed and thus provides a basis for the study of such rotating BHs. 

#### **Quasinormal modes of a holonomy corrected Schwarzschild black hole**
 - **Authors:** Zeus S. Moreira, Haroldo C. D. Lima Junior, Luís C. B. Crispino, Carlos A. R. Herdeiro
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14722)
 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a recently obtained solution of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) with corrections motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). This spacetime is regular everywhere and presents the global structure of a wormhole, with a minimal surface whose radius depends on a LQG parameter. We focus on the investigation of massless scalar field perturbations over the spacetime. We compute the QNMs with the WKB approximation, as well as the continued fraction method. The QNM frequency orbits, for $l=0$ and $n>0$, where $l$ and $n$ are the multipole and overtone numbers, respectively, are self-intersecting, spiraling curves in the complex plane. These orbits accumulate to a fixed complex value corresponding to the QNMs of the extremal case. We obtain that, for small values of the LQG parameter, the overall damping decreases as we increase the LQG parameter. Moreover the spectrum of the quantum corrected black hole exhibits an oscillatory pattern, which might imply in the existence of QNMs with vanishing real part. This pattern suggests that the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ for the real part of the QNMs is not well-defined, what differs from Schwarzschild's case. We also analyze the time-domain profiles for the scalar perturbations, showing that the LQG correction does not alter the Schwarzschild power-law tail. We compute the fundamental mode from the time profile by means of the Prony method, obtaining excellent agreement with the two previously mentioned methods. 

#### **One-loop corrections to the celestial chiral algebra from Koszul Duality**
 - **Authors:** Víctor E. Fernández
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14292)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider self-dual Yang-Mills theory (SDYM) in four dimensions and its lift to holomorphic BF theory on twistor space. Following the work of Costello and Paquette, we couple SDYM to a quartic axion field, which guarantees associativity of the (extended) celestial chiral algebra at the quantum level. We demonstrate how to reproduce their one-loop quantum deformation to the chiral algebra using Koszul duality.

#### **Kerr-like black hole and generalized uncertainty principle**
 - **Authors:** Meirong Tang, Zhaoyi Xu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13839](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13839)
 - **Abstract**
 Based on string theory, loop quantum gravity, black hole physics, and other theories of quantum gravity, physicists have proposed generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) modifications. In this work, we obtain exact solutions of Einstein$'$s field equations when the GUP effect is taken into account, and these solutions describe the GUP modifications for rotating black holes. We analyze two different ways of constructing GUP rotating black holes (Model $I$ and Model $II$). Model $I$ takes into account the modification of mass by GUP, i.e. the change of mass by quantization of space, and the resulting GUP-rotating black hole metric (18) is similar in form to Kerr black holes. Model $II$ takes into account the modification of the rotating black hole when GUP is an external field, where GUP acts like an electric charge, and the resulting GUP-rotating black hole metric (19) is similar in form to Kerr-Newman black holes. If the GUP-rotating black holes (18) and (19) are thermodynamically self-consistent, the functional relation of the GUP model parameters corresponding to Model $I$ and Model $II$ can be obtained. The difference between (18) and (19) in the space-time linear structure provides a basis for us to examine the physical nature of GUP-rotating black holes from observation, which is of great significance for understanding the GUP modification of black holes.

#### **The Generalized Uncertainty Principle and Higher Dimensions: Linking  Black Holes and Elementary Particles**
 - **Authors:** B. J. Carr
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12609](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12609)
 - **Abstract**
 Black holes play an important role in linking microphysics with macrophysics, with those of the Planck mass ($M_P \sim10^{-5}$g) featuring in any theory of quantum gravity. In particular, the Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence posits a smooth transition between the Compton wavelength ($R_C \propto 1/M$) below the Planck mass and the Schwarzschild radius ($R_{\rm S} \propto M$) above it. The duality between $R_{\rm C}$ and $R_{\rm S}$ implies a form of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and suggests that elementary particles may be sub-Planckian black holes. The simplest possibility is that the ADM mass has the form $M + \beta M_P^2/M$ for some constant $\beta$ and this model can be extended to charged and rotating black holes, clearly relevant to elementary particles. Another possibility is that sub-Planckian black holes may arise in loop quantum gravity and this explicitly links black holes and elementary particles. Higher dimensions may modify both proposals. If there are $n$ extra dimensions, all with the same compactification scale, one expects $R_{\rm S} \propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ below this scale but $R_{\rm C}$ depends on the form of the higher-dimensional wave-function. If it is spherically symmetric, then $R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1}$, so duality is broken and the Planck mass is reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity. If the wave-function is pancaked in the extra dimensions, $R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$ and so duality is preserved but the Planck mass is unchanged. 

#### **Geometry Transition in Spinfoams**

 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12622)
 - **Abstract**
 We show how the fixed-spin asymptotics of the EPRL model can be used to perform the spin-sum for spin foam amplitudes defined on fixed two-complexes without interior faces and contracted with coherent spin-network states peaked on a discrete simplicial geometry with macroscopic areas. We work in the representation given in Ref. 1. We first rederive the latter in a different way suitable for our purposes. We then extend this representation to 2-complexes with a boundary and derive its relation to the coherent state representation. We give the measure providing the resolution of the identity for Thiemann's state in the twisted geometry parametrization. The above then permit us to put everything together with other results in the literature and show how the spin sum can be performed analytically for the regime of interest here. These results are relevant to analytic investigations regarding the transition of a black hole to a white hole geometry. In particular, this work gives detailed technique that was the basis of estimate for the black to white bounce appeared in Ref. 2. These results may also be relevant for applications of spinfoams to investigate the possibility of a 'big bounce'. 

#### **Corner symmetry and quantum geometry**

 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12799](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12799)
 - **Abstract**
 By virtue of the Noether theorems, the vast gauge redundancy of general relativity provides us with a rich algebra of boundary charges that generate physical symmetries. These charges are located at codimension-2 entangling surfaces called corners. The presence of non-trivial corner symmetries associated with any entangling cut provides stringent constraints on the theory's mathematical structure and a guide through quantization. This report reviews new and recent results for non-perturbative quantum gravity, which are natural consequences of this structure. First, we establish that the corner symmetry derived from the gauge principle encodes quantum entanglement across internal boundaries. We also explain how the quantum representation of the corner symmetry algebra provides us with a notion of quantum geometry. We then focus our discussion on the first-order formulation of gravity and show how many results obtained in the continuum connect naturally with previous results in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we show that it is possible to get, purely from quantization and without discretization, an area operator with discrete spectrum, which is covariant under local Lorentz symmetry. We emphasize that while loop gravity correctly captures some of the gravitational quantum numbers, it does not capture all of them, which points towards important directions for future developments. Finally, we discuss the understanding of the gravitational dynamics along null surfaces as a conservation of symmetry charges associated with a Carrollian fluid.
