#### **Abelianized structures in spherically symmetric hypersurface  deformations: Inconsistency of a quantum notion of covariance in models of  loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07693](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07693)
 - **Abstract**
 In canonical gravity, general covariance is implemented by hypersurface-deformation symmetries on phase space. The different versions of hypersurface deformations required for full covariance have complicated interplays with one another, governed by non-Abelian brackets with structure functions. For spherically symmetric space-times, it is possible to identify a certain Abelian substructure within general hypersurface deformations, which suggests a simplified realization as a Lie algebra. The generators of this substructure can be quantized more easily than full hypersurface deformations, but the symmetries they generate do not directly correspond to hypersurface deformations. The availability of consistent quantizations therefore does not guarantee general covariance or a meaningful quantum notion thereof. In addition to placing the Abelian substructure within the full context of spherically symmetric hypersurface deformation, this paper points out several subtleties relevant for attempted applications in quantized space-time structures. In particular, it follows that recent constructions by Gambini, Olmedo and Pullin in an Abelianized setting fail to address the covariance crisis of loop quantum gravity.

#### **3-dimensional mixed BF theory and Hitchin's integrable system**
 - **Authors:** Benoit Vicedo, Jennifer Winstone
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07300)
 - **Abstract**
 The affine Gaudin model, associated with an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra, is known to arise from a certain gauge fixing of 4-dimensional mixed topological-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that the finite Gaudin model, associated with a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra, or more generally the tamely ramified Hitchin system on an arbitrary Riemann surface, can likewise be obtained from a similar gauge fixing of 3-dimensional mixed BF theory in the Hamiltonian framework.
