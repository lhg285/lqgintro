#### **Title:
          Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects**

 - **Abstract**
 We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMR waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.

#### **Title:
          The black hole shadow of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder-de Sitter spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Shu Luo
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the black hole shadow of an exact black hole solution of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) theory. We discuss some of its optical characteristics after generalizing it to the rotational case, including null geodesics and black hole shadow. From these we can compare the impact of different theories on the most deeply understood characteristics of the black hole and get a new way to test the accuracy of the modified gravity theory.
