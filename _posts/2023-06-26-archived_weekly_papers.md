#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Is the diagonal case a general picture for Loop Quantum Cosmology?**
 - **Authors:** Matteo Bruno, Giovanni Montani
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10934](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10934)
 - **Abstract**
 The correct implementation of the Loop Quantum Gravity to the early homogeneous Universe has been the subject of a long debate in the literature because the SU(2) symmetry cannot be properly retained. The role of this symmetry is expressed by the Gauss constraint. Here, a non-vanishing Gauss constraint is found. However, we show that using suitable variables, it can be recast into three Abelian constraints, justifying the absence of such a symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology.

#### **On the gravitational diagram technique in the discrete setup**
 - **Authors:** V.M. Khatsymovsky
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11531)
 - **Abstract**
 This article is in the spirit of our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal initial point of the perturbative expansion after functional integration over connection. Now consider the perturbative expansion itself. To obtain an algorithmizable diagram technique, we consider the simplest periodic simplicial structure with a frozen part of the variables ("hypercubic"). After functional integration over connection, the system is described by the metric $g_{\lambda \mu}$ at the sites. We parameterize $g_{\lambda \mu}$ so that the functional measure becomes Lebesgue. The discrete diagrams are finite and reproduce (for ordinary, non-Planck external momenta) those continuum counterparts that are finite. We give the parametrization of $g_{\lambda \mu}$ up to terms, providing, in particular, additional three-graviton and two-graviton-two-matter vertices, which can give additional one-loop corrections to the Newtonian potential. The edge length scale is $\sim \sqrt{ \eta }$, where $\eta$ defines the free factor $ ( - \det \| g_{\lambda \mu} \| )^{ \eta / 2}$ in the measure and should be a large parameter to ensure the true action after integration over connection. We verify the important fact that the perturbative expansion does not contain increasing powers of $\eta$ if its initial point is chosen close enough to the maximum point of the measure, thus justifying this choice.
