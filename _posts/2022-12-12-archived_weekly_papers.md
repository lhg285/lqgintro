 - **Abstract**
 For the calculation of gravitational deflection angle in Gibbons-Werner (GW) method, a simplified formula is derived by analyzing the surface integral of Gaussian curvature in the geometric expression. The usage of our simplified formula is two folded. (a) One can calculate the deflection angle more easily with the new formula. Taking the massive particles in a rotating black hole in loop quantum gravity (LQG) as an example, we show the new calculation process and obtain the finite-distance weak gravitational deflection angle which can generalize existing special cases. (b) Different from the conventional treatment, the new calculation process based on our simplified formula does not involve the quantities at infinity, and may be applicable to asymptotically nonflat spacetimes. For the photons in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime and the massive particles in Schwarzschild-like spacetime in bumblebee gravity model, we obtain the desirable deflection angles by using the simplified formula. The results of other asymptotically nonflat spacetimes in previous works are also reproduced perfectly with our new calculation formula.

#### **Spherical symmetric gravitational collapse of a dust cloud: polymerized  dynamics in reduced phase space**
 - **Authors:** Kristina Giesel, Muxin Han, Bao-Fei Li, Hongguang Liu, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01930)
 - **Abstract**
 Based on the effective dynamics in the $\bar \mu$ scheme of the spherical symmetry reduced model in the reduced phase space formulation of loop quantum gravity (LQG), we investigate the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud, with Gaussian dust serving as both the reference field and the source of the gravitational collapse. The effective dynamics from the considered model for a homogeneous dust cloud reduces precisely to the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) with extrinsic curvature based K-quantization, indicating that the LQC effective dynamics lives as a subsector of the model presented here. In both the marginally bound and the bound cases of the collapse in effective dynamics, the singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce. Though quantum geometric modification from spatial curvature is not directly included in the K-quantization it does affect the qualitative dynamics of the collapsing dust cloud in the sense that on the one hand for the marginally bound case, the dust cloud bounces once at fixed maximum energy density and on the other hand for the bound case, the dust cloud undergoes infinite cycles of contraction and expansion at energy densities dependent on the dust mass. Finally, the mass threshold for the formation of a trapped surface in each case is found and the matching conditions between the interior collapsing spacetime and an effective exterior static solution are discussed.

#### **Fermions in Loop Quantum Gravity and Resolution of Doubling Problem**
 - **Authors:** Cong Zhang, Hongguang Liu, Muxin Han
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00933)
 - **Abstract**
 The fermion propagator is derived in detail from the model of fermion coupled to loop quantum gravity. As an ingredient of the propagator, the vacuum state is defined as the ground state of some effective fermion Hamiltonian under the background geometry given by a coherent state resembling the classical Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, as a critical feature of loop quantum gravity, the superposition over graphs is employed to define the vacuum state. It turns out that the graph superposition leads to the propagator being the average of the propagators of the lattice field theory over various graphs so that all fermion doubler modes are suppressed in the propagator. This resolves the doubling problem in loop quantum gravity. Our result suggests that the superposition nature of quantum geometry should, on the one hand, resolve the tension between fermion and the fundamental discreteness and, on the other hand, relate to the continuum limit of quantum gravity. 

#### **Impact of generalized holonomy corrections on the cosmological  primordial power spectra**
 - **Authors:** Maxime De Sousa, Killian Martineau, Cyril Renevey, Aurélien Barrau
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01182)
 - **Abstract**
 The propagation of perturbations is studied with generalized holonomy corrections in a fully consistent way, ensuring that the deformed algebra of constraints remain closed. The primordial cosmological power spectra are calculated. It is shown that, although the detailed form of the correction does unavoidably impact the observables, the main known results of loop quantum cosmology are robust in this respect.
