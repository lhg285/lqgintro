#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Ergodic Concepts for a Self-Organizing Trivalent Spin Network**
 - **Authors:** Christine C. Dantas (Astrophysics Division, INPE, Brazil)
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16009](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16009)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider, from a dynamical systems point of view, a frozen, planar trivalent spin network model in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) presenting self-organized criticality (SOC). We obtain a partition function for the domains of stability connecting gauge non-invariant avalanches, leading to an entropy formula for the asymptotic SOC state. We use this formalism to obtain the entropy of a $(2+1)$-dimensional (BTZ) black hole, and conjecture that this entropy reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law by an appropriate adjustment of a potential function. 

#### **A reduced phase space quantisation of a model in Algebraic Quantum  Gravity with polarised $T^3$ Gowdy symmetry**
 - **Authors:** Kristina Giesel, Andreas Leitherer, David Winnekens
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16237)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider a reduced phase space quantisation of a model with $T^3$ Gowdy symmetry in which gravity has been coupled to Gaussian dust. We complete the quantisation programme in reduced loop quantum gravity (LQG) as well as algebraic quantum gravity (AQG) and derive a Schr\"odinger-like equation with a physical Hamiltonian operator encoding the dynamics. Due to the classical symmetries of the physical Hamiltonian, the operators are quantised in a graph-preserving way in both cases -- a difference to former models available in the literature. As a first step towards applications of the model in AQG, we consider an ansatz that we use to first construct zero volume states as specific solutions of the Schr\"odiger-like equation. We then also find states with a vanishing action of the Euclidean part of the physical Hamiltonian and investigate the degeneracies these states experience via the action of the Lorentzian part of the physical Hamiltonian. The results presented here can be taken as a starting point for deriving effective models as well as analysing the dynamics numerically in future work.

#### **Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity: Rovelli's lectures on LQG**
 - **Authors:** Pietropaolo Frisoni
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12215](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12215)
 - **Abstract**
 These notes are a transcript of Carlo Rovelli's lectures on Loop Quantum Gravity, given in Marseille in 2018, which (at present) can be entirely found on YouTube. I transcribed them in LaTeX in early 2020 as an exercise to get ready for my Ph.D. in LQG at Western University. This transcript is meant to be a (hopefully helpful) integration for the video version. I reported the order of the topics and the chronological structure exactly as presented by Rovelli throughout the course, primarily to facilitate the comparison. Each Section corresponds to a different Lecture. The parts written in textit are my additions. Sometimes in the text, I report references, which specify precisely the minute and the second of the corresponding video on YouTube, to very short historical digressions or excursus made during the lectures by Rovelli that I have not explicitly transcribed in these notes. Where appropriate, I took some figures from the book "Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity - An elementary introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory" by Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto, to which I always refer by the term "the book" in the following. For what concerns the equations, where possible, I tried to write down the "correct" versions present within the book. Finally, I thank Carlo Rovelli himself for reviewing these notes. I apologize in advance for any errors, and I wish everyone a lot of fun! 

#### **Constraints on rotating self-dual black hole with quasi-periodic  oscillations**

 - **Abstract**
 An impressive feature of loop quantum gravity (LQG) is that it can elegantly resolve both the big bang and black hole singularities. By using the Newman-Janis algorithm, a regular and effective rotating self-dual black hole(SDBH) metric could be constructed, which alters the Kerr geometry with a polymeric function $P$ from the quantum effects of LQG geometry. In this paper, we investigate its impact on the frequency characteristics of the X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations(QPOs) from 5 X-ray binaries and contrast it with the existing results of the orbital, periastron precession and nodal precession frequencies within the relativistic precession model. We apply a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation to examine the possible LQG effects on the X-ray QPOs. We found that the best constraint result for the rotating self-dual geometry from LQG came from the QPOs of X-ray binary GRO J1655-40, which establish an upper bound on the polymeric function $P$ less than $8.6\times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% confidence level. This bound leads to a restriction on the polymeric parameter $\delta$ of LQG to be 0.24.
