 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides a review of the frameworks developed for cosmological perturbation theory in loop quantum cosmology, and applications to various models of the early universe including inflation, ekpyrosis and the matter bounce, with an emphasis on potential observational consequences. It also includes a discussion on extensions to include non-Gaussianities and background anisotropies, as well as on its limitations concerning trans-Planckian perturbations and quantization ambiguities. It concludes with a summary of recent work studying the relation between loop quantum cosmology and full loop quantum gravity.

#### **Peculiar properties in quasi-normal spectra from loop quantum gravity  effect**

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectra for scalar and electromagnetic fields over a covairant loop quantum gravity black hole (LQG-BH). For the fundamental modes, the LQG effect reduces the oscillations in the scalar field, however it induces stronger oscillations in the electromagnetic field, comparing to the classical case. Under the scalar field perturbation, the system enjoys faster decaying modes with more oscillations than the electromagnetic field. Some peculiar phenomena emerge in the scalar field's QNM spectra with high overtones for the angular quantum numbers $l>0$. It is that the LQG-BH has a larger real part of QNM with high overtones than the Schwarzschild black hole (SS-BH). Such an anomalous phenomenon results in the oscillation of the scalar field in the LQG-BH to be nearly identical to that in the SS-BH. Therefore, the high overtone modes of the scalar field in LQG-BH play an important role in the modes with $l>0$. This anomalous phenomenon, however, does not occur in the electromagnetic field's QNM spectra.
