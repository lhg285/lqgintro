#### **Generalised Amit-Roginsky model from perturbations of 3d quantum gravity**

 - **Abstract**
 A generalised Amit-Roginsky vector model in flat space is obtained as the effective dynamics of pertubations around a classical solution of the Boulatov group field theory for 3d euclidean quantum gravity, extended to include additional matter degrees of freedom. By further restricting the type of perturbations, the original Amit-Roginsky model can be obtained. This result suggests a general link (and possibly a unified framework) between two types of tensorial quantum field theories: quantum geometric group field theories and tensorial models for random geometry, on one hand, and melonic-dominated vector and tensorial models in flat space, such as the Amit-Roginsky model (and the SYK model), on the other hand.

#### **Effects of the inflaton potential on the primordial power spectrum in  Loop Quantum Cosmology scenarios**
 - **Authors:** Beatriz Elizaga Navascués, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Jesús Yébana Carrilero
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12026)
 - **Abstract**
 In scenarios of physical interest in Loop Quantum Cosmology, with a preinflationary epoch where the kinetic energy of the inflaton dominates, the analytic study of the dynamics of the primordial fluctuations has been carried out by neglecting the inflaton potential in those stages of the evolution. In this work we develop approximations to investigate the influence of the potential as the period of kinetic dominance gives way to the inflationary regime, treating the potential as a perturbation. Specifically, we study how the potential modifies the effective mass that dictates the dynamics of the scalar perturbations in the preinflationary epochs, within the framework of the so-called hybrid prescription for Loop Quantum Cosmology. Moreover, we motivate and model a transition period that connects the kinetically dominated regime with inflation, allowing us to study the interval of times where the contribution of the potential is no longer negligible but an inflationary description is not yet valid. Finally, we include the main modifications coming from a slow-roll approximation to the evolution of the perturbations during inflation. We analytically solve the dynamics of the perturbations in each of these different epochs of cosmological evolution, starting from initial conditions fixed by the criterion of asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization. This allows us to compute the primordial power spectrum, which we evaluate and quantitatively analyze in a particular case, with a quadratic inflaton potential.

#### **Conformally Invariant Brans-Dicke Loop Quantum Cosmology: A Quantum  Geometric Model of Linking Theory**
 - **Authors:** Chun-Yen Lin, Xiangjing Liu, Yongge Ma, Cong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11222](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11222)
 - **Abstract**
 The loop quantization of the conformal Brans-Dicke cosmology is explored in the spatially flat and Bianchi-I setting. The scalar and conformal constraints governing the canonical model are quantized using the loop techniques. The physical Hilbert space of quantum spacetimes satisfying both quantum constraints is then obtained by incorporating the quantum geometric features. The Schr\"odinger cosmic evolutions are derived with the relational Heisenberg observables describing the dynamical degrees of freedom with respect to the chosen reference degrees of freedom, with the latter providing the physical coordinates for the spatial hypersurfaces and the conformal scales. We show that the emerging Schr\"odinger theories contain not only the loop quantum cosmology of GR, but also that of the so-called shape dynamics. The exact dictionary between the two theories is achieved via the underlying physical Hilbert space possessing the additional (loop-corrected) conformal symmetry.
