#### **Title:
          Off-shell double copy theories in BV**
 - **Authors:** Maor Ben-Shahar, Francesco Bonechi, Maxim Zabzine

 - **Abstract**
 We present a construction of the double copy for gauge theories that exhibit off-shell color-kinematics duality within the Batalin-Vilkovitsky (BV) formalism. As illustrative examples, we consider the double copies of Chern-Simons theory, four-dimensional BF theory, and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, and we discuss possible gravity interpretations for these cases. We formalize the construction and demonstrate that Kodaira-Spencer gravity, Kähler gravity, and their generalizations, fit naturally within this framework. In particular, Kodaira-Spencer gravity emerges as a gauge theory describing deformations of generalized complex structures, while the double copy of Chern-Simons theory captures the deformation of the Courant bracket.

#### **Title:
          Quantum Effective Dynamics of Papapetrou Spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Xiaokan Guo, Faqiang Yuan
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the quantum effective dynamics of Papapetrou spacetime by using methods from loop quantum gravity. The Papapetrou spacetime is an extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with an extra coupled anti-scalar field. By solving the equations of motion generated by the Hamiltonian constraint for Papapetrou spacetime, we can construct the quantum effective metric. The resulting effective metric for the quantum-corrected Papapetrou spacetime demonstrates the quantum effects inevitably give rise to a new wormhole throat while the classical wormhole throat disappear in the case of extremely small mass.
