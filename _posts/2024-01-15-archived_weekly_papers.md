 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a notion of residual diffeomorphism covariance in quantum Kantowski-Sachs (KS), describing the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. We solve for the family of Hamiltonian constraint operators satisfying the associated covariance condition, as well as parity invariance, preservation of the Bohr Hilbert space of Loop Quantum KS and a correct (na\"ive) classical limit. We further explore imposing minimality of the number of terms, and compare the solution with other Hamiltonian constraints proposed for Loop Quantum KS in the literature. In particular, we discuss a lapse recently commonly chosen due to the resulting decoupling of evolution of the two degrees of freedom and exact solubility of the model. We show that such a lapse choice can indeed be quantized as an operator densely defined on the Bohr Hilbert space, and that any such operator must include an infinite number of shift operators.

#### **Phases of theories with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry and the roles of  center vortices and magnetic monopoles**
 - **Authors:** Mendel Nguyen, Tin Sulejmanpasic, Mithat Ünsal
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that in spacetime dimensions $d=2$ only the confined phase is generically possible. In $d=3,4$ the confined phase and a topological BF phase are both generic, while in $d=4$ a phase with a massless photon is also possible. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but not sufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.
