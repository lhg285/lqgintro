          Black hole tunneling in loop quantum gravity**

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.

#### **Title:
          Lessons for loop quantum gravity from emergent modified gravity**
 - **Authors:** Idrus Husin Belfaqih, Martin Bojowald, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Erick I. Duque

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the potential physical effects of loop quantum gravity have been derived in effective models that modify the constraints of canonical general relativity in specific forms. Emergent modified gravity evaluates important conditions that ensure the existence of a compatible geometrical space-time interpretation of canonical solutions, as well as phase-space covariance under different choices of canonical variables. This setting, specialized to modifications suggested by loop quantum gravity, is therefore an important contribution to physical evaluations of this approach to quantum gravity. Here, it is shown that emergent modified gravity restricts several ambiguities that existed in previous formulations, rules out several specific candidates, and provides a unified treatment of different types of (holonomy) modifications that had been thought to be physically distinct.

#### **Title:
          Sine-dilaton gravity vs double-scaled SYK: exploring one-loop quantum corrections**
 - **Authors:** Leonardo Bossi, Luca Griguolo, Jacopo Papalini, Lorenzo Russo, Domenico Seminara
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We provide non-trivial checks of the recently proposed duality between double-scaled SYK and a 2d dilaton gravity model with sine potential, studying the path integral at one-loop level. Specifically, we compute the logarithmic correction to the free energy of sine-dilaton gravity and, up to potential ordering ambiguities, we find a match with the corresponding quantity in double-scaled SYK. The computation relies on the description of sine-dilaton gravity in terms of a version of the q-Schwarzian theory, the quantum deformation of the standard Schwarzian model dual to JT gravity. A crucial aspect of the calculation is selecting the correct Hartle-Hawking vacuum for the gravitational theory, which implies a specific choice of boundary conditions for the one-loop determinant, computed using a generalization of the Gel'fand-Yaglom's theorem. We also evaluate the gravitational one-loop correction to the boundary to boundary propagator of a non-minimally coupled matter field in the bulk theory, showing a perfect agreement with the corresponding quantum correction of matter correlators in double-scaled SYK.
