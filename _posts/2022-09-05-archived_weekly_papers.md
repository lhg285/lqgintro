 - **Abstract**
 According to some quantum gravity models, Lorentz invariance can be violated in the Planck energy scale. With this motivation, we analyze the thermal quantities and the stability of Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in gravity's rainbow formalism. To do that, we consider the rainbow functions which are motivated by loop quantum gravity and gamma-ray bursts, and we derive Hawking temperature, specific heat, entropy and the equation of state function. We observe that the presence the quintessence matter field and rainbow gravity affect the stability of the black hole.
