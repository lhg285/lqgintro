#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Cyclic cocycles and one-loop corrections in the spectral action**
 - **Authors:** Teun D. H. van Nuland, Walter D. van Suijlekom
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10094](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10094)
 - **Abstract**
 We present an intelligible review of recent results concerning cyclic cocycles in the spectral action and one-loop quantization. We show that the spectral action, when perturbed by a gauge potential, can be written as a series of Chern-Simons actions and Yang-Mills actions of all orders. In the odd orders, generalized Chern-Simons forms are integrated against an odd $(b,B)$-cocycle, whereas, in the even orders, powers of the curvature are integrated against $(b,B)$-cocycles that are Hochschild cocycles as well. In both cases, the Hochschild cochains are derived from the Taylor series expansion of the spectral action Tr$(f(D+V))$ in powers of $V=\pi_D(A)$, but unlike the Taylor expansion we expand in increasing order of the forms in $A$. We then analyze the perturbative quantization of the spectral action in noncommutative geometry and establish its one-loop renormalizability as a gauge theory. We show that the one-loop counterterms are of the same Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills form so that they can be safely subtracted from the spectral action. A crucial role will be played by the appropriate Ward identities, allowing for a fully spectral formulation of the quantum theory at one loop.

#### **Transition Amplitudes in 3D Quantum Gravity: Boundaries and Holography  in the Coloured Boulatov Model**
 - **Authors:** Christophe Goeller, Daniele Oriti, Gabriel Schmid
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09159)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider transition amplitudes in the coloured simplicial Boulatov model for three-dimensional Riemannian quantum gravity. First, we discuss aspects of the topology of coloured graphs with non-empty boundaries. Using a modification of the standard rooting procedure of coloured tensor models, we then write transition amplitudes systematically as topological expansions. We analyse the transition amplitudes for the simplest boundary topology, the 2-sphere, and prove that they factorize into a sum entirely given by the combinatorics of the boundary spin network state and that the leading order is given by graphs representing the closed 3-ball in the large N limit. This is the first step towards a more detailed study of the holographic nature of coloured Boulatov-type GFT models for topological field theories and quantum gravity.

#### **Leading all-loop quantum contribution to the effective potential in  general scalar field theory**
 - **Authors:** D. I. Kazakov, R.M. Iakhibbaev, D. M. Tolkachev
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08019)
 - **Abstract**
 The RG equation for the effective potential in the leading log (LL) approximation is constructed which is valid for an arbitrary scalar field theory in 4 dimensions. The solution to this equation sums up the leading log\phi contributions to all orders of perturbation theory. In general, this is the second order nonlinear partial differential equation, but in some cases it can be reduced to the ordinary one. For particular examples, this equation is solved numerically and the LL effective potential is constructed. The solution has a characteristic discontinuity replacing the Landau pole typical for the phi^4 theory. For a power-like potential no new minima appear due to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
