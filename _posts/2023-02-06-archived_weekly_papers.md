#### **Summing bulk quantum numbers with Monte Carlo in spin foam theories**
 - **Authors:** Pietro Dona, Pietropaolo Frisoni
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00072](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00072)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a strategy to compute EPRL spin foam amplitudes with many internal faces numerically. We work with \texttt{sl2cfoam-next}, the state-of-the-art framework to numerically evaluate spin foam transition amplitudes. We find that uniform sampling Monte Carlo is exceptionally effective in approximating the sum over internal quantum numbers of a spin foam amplitude, considerably reducing the computational resources necessary. We apply it to compute large volume divergences of the theory and find surprising numerical evidence that the EPRL vertex renormalization amplitude is instead finite.

#### **Primordial black holes in loop quantum gravity: The effect on the  threshold**
 - **Authors:** Theodoros Papanikolaou
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11439)
 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes form in the early Universe and constitute one of the most viable candidates for dark matter. The study of their formation process requires the determination of a critical energy density perturbation threshold $\delta_\mathrm{c}$, which in general depends on the underlying gravity theory. Up to now, the majority of analytic and numerical techniques calculate $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ within the framework of general relativity. In this work, using simple physical arguments we estimate semi-analytically the PBH formation threshold within the framework of quantum gravity, working for concreteness within loop quantum gravity (LQG), which constitutes a non-perturbative and background-independent quantization of general relativity. In particular, for low mass PBHs formed close to the quantum bounce, we find a reduction in the value of $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ up to $50\%$ compared to the general relativistic regime quantifying for the first time to the best of our knowledge how quantum effects can influence PBH formation within a quantum gravity framework. Finally, by varying the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ of LQG we show its effect on the value of $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ while using the observational/phenomenological signatures associated to ultra-light PBHs, namely the ones affected by LQG effects, we propose the PBH portal as a novel probe to constrain the potential quantum nature of gravity.
