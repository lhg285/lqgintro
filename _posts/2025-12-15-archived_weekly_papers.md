#### **Title:
          (Pre)-Inflationary Dynamics with Starobinsky Potential in Noncommutative Effective LQC**

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the (pre)-inflationary dynamics of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe governed by the Starobinsky potential within the framework of noncommutative effective loop quantum cosmology. The field equations are solved numerically for various initial conditions and different values of the noncommutative parameter. We analyze the background dynamics for three representative regimes -- the extreme kinetic-energy domination, kinetic-energy domination, and potential-energy domination. A complementary analysis is performed from the viewpoint of dynamical systems, highlighting the qualitative features of the scalar field evolution. Finally, a discussion comparing our results with previous studies employing the chaotic (quadratic) potential in the same formalism is presented.
