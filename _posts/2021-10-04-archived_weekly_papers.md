#### **Higher form Yang-Mills as higher BFYM theories**
 - **Authors:** Danhua Song, Kai Lou, Ke Wu, Jie Yang
 - **Subjects:** Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13443](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13443)
 - **Abstract**
 We give a brief overview how to generalize a BF theory to 2BF and 3BF theories within the higher gauge theory framework. We find that, for the BF theory, there is a deformation giving the formulation of the standard Yang-Mills theory. In this work we study the generalizations of the Yang-Mills theory to the 2-form Yang-Mills theory and construct the 3-form Yang-Mills theory. Then, for the 2BF and 3BF theories, we give good deformed models, 2BFYM and 3BFYM, describing the corresponding dynamics of 2-form Yang-Mills and 3-form Yang-Mills.

#### **Modified regular black holes with time delay and 1-loop quantum  correction**
 - **Authors:** Yi Ling, Meng-He Wu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12938)
 - **Abstract**
 We develop the regular black hole solutions recently proposed in arXiv:2109.05974 by incorporating the 1-loop quantum correction to the Newton potential as well as a time delay between an observer at the regular center and that at infinity. We define the maximal time delay between the center and the infinity by scanning the mass of black holes such that the sub-Planckian feature of Kretschmann scalar curvature is preserved during the whole process of evaporation. We also compare the distinct behavior of Kretschmann curvature for black holes with an asymptotically Minkowski core and those with an asymptotically de-Sitter core, including Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We expect that this sort of regular black holes may provide more information about the construction of effective metric for Planck stars.
