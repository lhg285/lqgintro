#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Effective LQG dynamics of a thin shell and the fate of a collapsing star**
 - **Authors:** Francesco Fazzini
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Effective models inspired by loop quantum gravity typically resolve the central singularity by replacing it with a bounce of the matter density in the Planckian regime. In the specific model analyzed here, this bounce is generally followed by the formation of shell-crossing singularities. The purpose of this work is to provide a physically meaningful extension of spacetime beyond the shell-crossing singularity. To this end, we derive the dynamics of a dust thin shell within the effective Hamiltonian framework. The motion of the shell remains timelike throughout: after undergoing a quantum-gravitational bounce, it expands and eventually emerges from the white-hole vacuum region.
