#### **Holographic entanglement in spin network states: a focused review**
 - **Authors:** Eugenia Colafranceschi, Gerardo Adesso
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 In the longstanding quest to reconcile gravity with quantum mechanics, profound connections have been unveiled between concepts traditionally pertaining to quantum information theory, such as entanglement, and constitutive features of gravity, like holography. Developing and promoting these connections from the conceptual to the operational level unlocks access to a powerful set of tools, which can be pivotal towards the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Here, we review recent progress on the role and applications of quantum informational methods, in particular tensor networks, for quantum gravity models. We focus on spin network states dual to finite regions of space, represented as entanglement graphs in the group field theory approach to quantum gravity, and illustrate how techniques from random tensor networks can be exploited to investigate their holographic properties. In particular, spin network states can be interpreted as maps from bulk to boundary, whose holographic behaviour increases with the inhomogeneity of their geometric data (up to becoming proper quantum channels). The entanglement entropy of boundary states, which are obtained by feeding such maps with suitable bulk states, is then proved to follow a bulk area law, with corrections due to the entanglement of the bulk state. We further review how exceeding a certain threshold of bulk entanglement leads to the emergence of a black hole-like region, revealing intriguing perspectives for quantum cosmology. 

#### **Exploratory applications of the Fröhlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism in  quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Axel Maas, Markus Markl, Michael Müller
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 A manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant approach to canonical quantum gravity requires to use composite operators. These can be considered to be bound states of matter and/or gravitons, intrinsically non-perturbative objects. An analytical approach to determine the properties of such bound states could be the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism. We explore the necessary technology by applying it to various $n$-point functions, including geon propagators and black-hole-particle vertices.

#### **How-To compute EPRL spin foam amplitudes**
 - **Authors:** Pietro Dona, Pietropaolo Frisoni
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 Spin foam theory is a concrete framework for quantum gravity where numerical calculations of transition amplitudes are possible. Recently, the field became very active, but the entry barrier is steep, mainly because of its unusual language and notions scattered around the literature. This paper is a pedagogical guide to spin foam transition amplitude calculations. We show how to write an EPRL-FK transition amplitude, from the definition of the 2-complex to its numerical implementation using \texttt{sl2cfoam-next}. We guide the reader using an explicit example balancing mathematical rigor with a practical approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and provide a novel look at a recently proposed approximation scheme.
