#### **Title:
          Anomaly freedom in effective Loop Quantum Cosmology refined: extended functional dependence of the counter-terms**
 - **Authors:** Maxime De Sousa, Aurélien Barrau, Killian Martineau
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Instead of assuming that they depend only on the background variables, we investigate the hypothesis that counter-terms appearing in the deformed algebra approach to loop quantum cosmology depend on the full phase-space variables. We derive the associated anomalies and solve the entire system in several specific cases. New restrictions on the generalized holonomy corrections are obtained.
