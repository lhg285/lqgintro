 - **Abstract**
 The effective dynamics of the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime inspired by loop quantum gravity is studied. Two different schemes are considered to regularize the Hamiltonian constraint for the quantum dynamics. In the $\mu_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $\mu_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Effective potential in $SO(N)$ symmetric scalar field theories in curved spacetime**
 - **Authors:** V.A. Filippov, R.M. Iakhibbaev, D. M. Tolkachev
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Abstract**
 We derive recurrence relations for leading logarithmic all-loop quantum corrections in the case of $SO(N)$ symmetric scalar theory with an arbitrary potential in curved spacetime. On this basis, a system of renormalisation group (RG) equations in the general is obtained approach for the effective potential in the large $N$ limit. As a simple illustration, we analyse the case of power-like potentials in the Jordan frame and discuss their application to inflationary cosmology.
