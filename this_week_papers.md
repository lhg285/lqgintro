#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Numerics of Bianchi type II and type IX spacetimes in effective loop  quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Timothy Blackmore, Edward Wilson-Ewing
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16747)
 - **Abstract**
 We numerically solve the effective loop quantum cosmology dynamics for the vacuum Bianchi type II and type IX spacetimes, in particular studying how the Kasner exponents evolve across the loop quantum cosmology bounce. We find that when the spatial curvature is negligible at the bounce then the Kasner exponents transform according to the same simple equation as for a Bianchi type I spacetime in effective loop quantum cosmology, while there are departures from this transformation rule in cases where the spatial curvature is significant during the bounce. We also use high-precision numerics to compute the evolution of a Bianchi type IX spacetime through multiple bounces and recollapses, and find indications of chaotic behaviour. Interestingly, the numerics indicate that it is during the classical recollapse, and not the loop quantum cosmology bounce, that nearby solutions diverge most strongly.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The topological order in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Jingbo Wang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15760)
 - **Abstract**
 Topological order (long-range entanglement) is a new type of order that beyond Landau's symmetry breaking theory. This concept plays important roles in modern condensed matter physics. The topological entanglement entropy provides a universal quantum number to characterize the topological order in a system. The topological entanglement entropy of the BTZ black hole was calculated and found that it coincides with that for fractional quantum Hall states. So the BTZ black hole has the same topological order with the fractional quantum Hall state. We show that the four dimensional black hole can also have topological order, by showing that the topological entanglement entropy of black holes is non-zero in loop quantum gravity. We also consider the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum gravity. By comparing with the BF theory, we found that the physical Hilbert space for loop quantum gravity is degenerate on non-trivial manifold, which indicate the existence of topological order in loop quantum gravity. We advise to bring in the methods and results in string-net condensation to loop quantum gravity to solve some difficult problems.
