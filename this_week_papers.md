#### **Title:
          Entanglement Entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity through Quantum Error Correction**
 - **Authors:** Sean Tobin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space. The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.

#### **Title:
          Lorentzian spinfoam gravity path integral and geometrical area-law entanglement entropy**
 - **Authors:** Muxin Han
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient $\beta>0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 < \gamma \lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.
