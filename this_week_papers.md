#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Information paradox and island of covariant black holes in LQG**
 - **Authors:** Yongbin Du, Jia-Rui Sun, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We study information paradox of four dimensional covariant black holes inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG) with two well motivated solutions. We first prepare the spacetime in the Hartle-Hawking state, compute the radiation entropy and recover a linear growth at late time. When considering the mass loss and incorporating greybody factors, we show that for Solution~1 the LQG parameter $\zeta$ leaves temperature and Planckian factor of the spectrum unchanged but enhances the near-horizon barrier, leading to a faster evaporation rate as $M$ decreases. This behavior contrasts sharply with Solution~2, which has slow evaporation rate at small $M$ and admits a non-singular continuation suggestive of a remnant or a black-to-white-hole transition. We then apply the island prescription on the eternal background and find that quantum extremal surfaces exist in solution 1 geometries; $\zeta$ primarily shifts the island boundary and suppresses the late time entropy growth, preserving unitarity. Our results highlight that covariance-respecting LQG black hole do not exhibit a universal late time behavior.

#### **Title:
          Hessian in the spinfoam models with cosmological constant**

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce a general method to prove the non-degeneracy of the Hessian in the spinfoam vertex amplitude for quantum gravity and apply it to the spinfoam models with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF models). By reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections, we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\Lambda$-SF model to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model. Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other spinfoam models under mild adjustments.
