#### **Title:
          Integrable models from 4d holomorphic BF theory**
 - **Authors:** Lewis T. Cole, Ben Hoare
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We show how to construct 2d field theories with holomorphic integrability from defect setups in 4d holomorphic BF. In a simple example setup, we explicitly construct the 2d theory and perform an initial classical analysis. Making use of the symmetries, we are able to write down an infinite family of solutions to the equations of motion. Comparing with more typical integrable systems, we explain how 2d holomorphic integrability sits between the standard notions of integrability in one and two dimensions. These 2d theories are designed as toy models for integrable theories in three and four dimensions, many of which can be understood as partially or totally holomorphic. We comment on the implications for higher-dimensional integrability and aspects of quantization in the concluding remarks.

#### **Title:
          Holographic Codes from Enriched Link Entanglement in Spin Networks**
 - **Authors:** Mai Qi, Eugenia Colafranceschi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an enriched entanglement structure for spin networks, inspired by tensor-network constructions, in which internal links can carry a controlled and discrete amount of entanglement. In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space.

#### **Title:
          Cosmic Acceleration from Quantum Gravity: Emergent Inflation and Dynamical Dark Energy**
 - **Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Tom R. Ladstätter, Daniele Oriti
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We present a mechanism for the emergence of cosmic acceleration within the mean-field approximation of Group Field Theory models of quantum gravity. Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations.
