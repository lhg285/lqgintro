#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Fermions in Loop Quantum Gravity and Resolution of Doubling Problem**
 - **Authors:** Cong Zhang, Hongguang Liu, Muxin Han
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00933)
 - **Abstract**
 The fermion propagator is derived in detail from the model of fermion coupled to loop quantum gravity. As an ingredient of the propagator, the vacuum state is defined as the ground state of some effective fermion Hamiltonian under the background geometry given by a coherent state resembling the classical Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, as a critical feature of loop quantum gravity, the superposition over graphs is employed to define the vacuum state. It turns out that the graph superposition leads to the propagator being the average of the propagators of the lattice field theory over various graphs so that all fermion doubler modes are suppressed in the propagator. This resolves the doubling problem in loop quantum gravity. Our result suggests that the superposition nature of quantum geometry should, on the one hand, resolve the tension between fermion and the fundamental discreteness and, on the other hand, relate to the continuum limit of quantum gravity. 

#### **Impact of generalized holonomy corrections on the cosmological  primordial power spectra**
 - **Authors:** Maxime De Sousa, Killian Martineau, Cyril Renevey, Aur√©lien Barrau

 - **Abstract**
 The propagation of perturbations is studied with generalized holonomy corrections in a fully consistent way, ensuring that the deformed algebra of constraints remain closed. The primordial cosmological power spectra are calculated. It is shown that, although the detailed form of the correction does unavoidably impact the observables, the main known results of loop quantum cosmology are robust in this respect.
