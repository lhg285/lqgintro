#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Including topology change in Loop Quantum Gravity with topspin network  formalism with application to homogeneous and isotropic cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Mattia Villani
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14188)
 - **Abstract**
 We apply topspin network formalism to Loop Quantum Gravity in order to include in the theory the possibility of changes in the topology of spacetime. We apply this formalism to three toy models: with the first, we find that the topology can actually change due to the action of the Hamiltonian constraint and with the second we find that the final state might be a superposition of states with different topologies. In the third and last application, we consider an homogeneous and isotropic Universe, calculating the difference equation that describes the evolution of the system and which are the final topological states after the action of the Hamiltonian constraint. For this last case, we also calculate the transition amplitudes and probabilities from the initial to the final states. 

#### **A Wick rotation for EPRL spin foam models**
 - **Authors:** Pietro Dona, Francesco Gozzini, Alessandro Nicotra
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14672)
 - **Abstract**
 We show that the Euclidean and Lorentzian EPRL vertex amplitudes of covariant Loop Quantum Gravity are related through a ``Wick rotation'' of the real Immirzi parameter to purely imaginary values. Our result follows from the simultaneous analytic continuation of the algebras, group elements and unitary irreducible representations of the gauge groups $Spin(4)$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$, applied to the decomposition of the two models in terms of $SU(2)$ invariants and booster functions.
