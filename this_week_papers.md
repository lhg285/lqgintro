#### **Title:
          Particle Deflections around Microscopic Loop Quantum Black Holes with Rigorous Quantum Parameters**
 - **Authors:** Haida Li, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 The detection of quantum gravity effects is highly limited in both macroscopic and microscopic scenarios: The small quantum parameter makes most large-scale observations practically indistinguishable from general relativity. While at the Planck scale, where the effect of quantum gravity is undoubtedly significant, the energy requirement is remarkably high for any test particle as a probe. In this work, by focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of both massless and massive particles around a microscopic loop quantum black hole, we show that given the current knowledge of ultra-high-energy particles, quantum corrections of relative scale $>10^{-10}$ can appear when the radius of the black hole horizon remains larger than the wavelength of high-energy Gamma rays, where the classical photon trajectory may still hold to a certain degree. In addition, more significant corrections can be observed when considering low velocity massive particles. Potentially, our results could suggest a new area for testing the effects of quantum gravity.

#### **Title:
          Black Hole Shadows Modelling in Extended gravity: Rotation Accounting and coupled effects**
 - **Authors:** Stanislav Alexeyev, Oleg Zenin, Artem Baiderin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Using an improved version of the Newman-Janis algorithm, we obtain metrics of rotating black holes for a set of extended gravity theories that extend general relativity in different ways: the Horndeski model, the bumblebee model, the Gauss-Bonnet scalar gravity, the loop quantum gravity, the conformal gravity, and $f(Q)$ (symmetric teleparallel gravity STEGR). The obtained metrics are used to model black hole shadows. It is shown that for some models the critical values of the angular momentum $a_{crit}$ emerge. The previous conclusion that the extended gravity theory corrects by itself the effects of rotation in both directions is confirmed. This appears to be important for further modelling of shadow profiles taking into account the constantly increasing accuracy of black hole images. Thus, when rotation is taken into account black hole shadow images, as the GW170817 test or the post-Newtonian formalism, can serve as a meaningful way to test and constrain extended theories of gravity.
