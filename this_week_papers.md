#### **Schrödinger from Wheeler-DeWitt: The Issues of Time and Inner  Product in Canonical Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Ali Kaya
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 The wave-function in quantum gravity is supposed to obey the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, however there is neither a satisfactory probability interpretation nor a successful solution to the problem of time in the WDW framework. To gain some insight on these issues we compare quantization of ordinary systems, first in the usual way having the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and second by promoting them as parametrized theories by introducing embedding coordinate fields, which yields first class constraints and the WDW equation. We observe that the time evolution in the WDW framework can be described with respect to the embedding coordinates, where the WDW equation becomes Schr\"{o}dinger like, i.e. it involves first order timelike functional derivatives. Moreover, the equivalence with the ordinary quantization procedure determines a suitable Hilbert space with a viable probability interpretation. We then apply the same construction to general relativity by adding embedding fields without any prior coordinate choice. The reparametrized general relativity has two different types of diffeomorphism invariance, which arises from world-volume and target-space reparametrizations. As in the case of ordinary systems, the time evolution can be described with respect to the embedding fields and the WDW equation becomes Schr\"{o}dinger like; the construction is almost identical to an ordinary parametrized field theory in terms of time evolution and Hilbert space structure. However, this time, the constraint algebra enforces the wave-function to be in a subspace of states annihilated by an operator that can be identified as the Hamiltonian. The implications of these results for the canonical quantization program, and in particular for the minisuperspace quantum cosmology, are discussed.

#### **3 Definitions of BF Theory on Homology 3-Spheres**
 - **Authors:** Matthias Blau, Mbambu Kakona, George Thompson
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Geometric Topology (math.GT)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10136)
 - **Abstract**
 3-dimensional BF theory with gauge group $G$ (= Chern-Simons theory with non-compact gauge group $TG$) is a deceptively simple yet subtle topological gauge theory. Formally, its partition function is a sum/integral over the moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ of flat connections, weighted by the Ray-Singer torsion. In practice, however, this formal expression is almost invariably singular and ill-defined. In order to improve upon this, we perform a direct evaluation of the path integral for certain classes of 3-manifolds (namely integral and rational Seifert homology spheres). By a suitable choice of gauge, we sidestep the issue of having to integrate over $\mathcal{M}$ and reduce the partition function to a finite-dimensional Abelian matrix integral which, however, itself requires a definition. We offer 3 definitions of this integral, firstly via residues, and then via a large $k$ limit of the corresponding $G\times G$ or $G_C$ Chern-Simons matrix integrals (obtained previously). We then check and discuss to which extent the results capture the expected sum/integral over all flat connections.
