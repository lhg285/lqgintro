#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Non-degenerate metrics, hypersurface deformation algebra, non-anomalous  representations and density weights in quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08299)
 - **Abstract**
 A basic assumption in classical GR is that the metric field is nowhere degenerate in spacetime. In particular the induced metric on Cauchy surfaces must be nowhere degenerate. It is only under this assumption that one can derive the hypersurace deformation algebra between the initial value constraints which is absolutely transparent from the fact that the {\it inverse} of the induced metric is needed to close the algebra. This statement is independent of the density weight that one may want to equip the spatial metric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation of the hypersurface defomation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the issue of non-degenracy of the induced metric that is needed in the classical theory. In the Hilbert space representation employed in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) most emphasis has been layed to define an inverse metric operator on the dense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum geometries which are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that demonstration of closure of the constraint algebra on this domain meets difficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically forbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical hypersurface deformation algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue such as non-standard operator topologies, dual spaces (habitats) and density weights have been propposed to address this issue with respect to the quantum dynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that insisting on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG representation may provide a natural resolution of the issue thereby possibly avoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions. 

#### **An open scattering model in polymerized quantum mechanics**
 - **Authors:** Kristina Giesel, Michael Kobler
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08749)
 - **Abstract**
 We derive a quantum master equation in the context of a polymerized open quantum mechanical system for the scattering of a Brownian particle in an ideal gas environment. The model is formulated in a top-down approach by choosing a Hamiltonian with a coupling between the system and environment that is generally associated with spatial decoherence. We extend the existing work on such models by using a non-standard representation of the canonical commutation relations, inspired by the quantization procedure applied in loop quantum gravity, which yields a model in which position operators are replaced by holonomies. The derivation of the master equation in a top-down approach opens up the possibility to investigate in detail whether the assumptions, usually used in such models in order to obtain a tractable form of the dissipator, hold also in the polymerized case or whether they need to be dropped or modified. Furthermore, we discuss some physical properties of the master equation associated to effective equations for the expectation values of the fundamental operators and compare our results to the already existing models of collisional decoherence. 

#### **Exact quantisation of U(1)$^3$ quantum gravity via exponentiation of the  hypersurface deformation algebroid**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08302)
 - **Abstract**
 The U(1)$^3$ model for 3+1 Euclidian signature general relativity is an interacting, generally covariant field theory with two physical polarisations that shares many features of Lorentzian general relativity. In particular, it displays a non-trivial realisation of the hypersurface deformation algebroid with non-trivial, i.e. phase space dependent structure functions rather than structure constants. In this paper we show that the model admits {\it an exact quantisation}. The quantisation rests on the observation that for this model and in the chosen representation of the canonical commutation relations the density unity hypersurface algebra {\it can be exponentiated on non-degenerate states}. These are states that represent a non-degenerate quantum metric and from a classical perspective are the relevant states on which the hypersurface algebra is representable. The representation of the algebra is exact, with no ambiguities involved and anomaly free. The quantum constraints can be exactly solved using {\it groupoid averaging} and the solutions admit a Hilbert space structure that agrees with the quantisation of a recently found reduced phase space formulation. Using the also recently found covariant action for that model, we start a path integral or spin foam formulation which, due to the Abelian character of the gauge group, is much simpler than for Lorentzian signature general relativity and provides an ideal testing ground for general spin foam models. 

#### **Renormalisation, wavelets and the Dirichlet-Shannon kernels**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** ['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'hep-lat']
 - **Arxiv link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08294v1)
 - **Abstract**
 In constructive quantum field theory (CQFT) it is customary to first
regularise the theory at finite UV and IR cut-off. Then one first removes the
UV cutoff using renormalisation techniques applied to families of CQFT's
labelled by finite UV resolutions and then takes the thermodynamic limit.
Alternatively, one may try to work directly without IR cut-off.
  More recently, wavelets have been proposed to define the renormalisation flow
of CQFT's which is natural as they come accompanied with a multi-resolution
analysis (MRA). However, wavelets so far have been mostly studied in the
non-compact case. Practically useful wavelets that display compact support and
some degree of smoothness can be constructed on the real line using Fourier
space techniques but explicit formulae as functions of position are rarely
available. Compactly supported wavelets can be periodised by summing over
period translates keeping orthogonality properties but still yield to rather
complicated expressions which generically lose their smoothness and position
locality properties.
  It transpires that a direct approach to wavelets in the compact case is
desirable. In this contribution we show that the Dirichlet-Shannon kernels
serve as a natural scaling function to define generalised orthonormal wavelet
bases on tori or copies of real lines respectively. These generalised wavelets
are smooth, are simple explicitly computable functions, display quasi-local
properties close to the Haar wavelet and have compact momentum supprt.
Accordingly they have a built-in cut-off both in position and momentum, making
them very useful for renormalisation applications.

#### **Hamiltonian Renormalisation VII: Free fermions and doubler free kernels**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** ['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'hep-lat']
 - **Arxiv link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08291v1)
 - **Abstract**
 The Hamiltonian renormalisation programme motivated by constructive QFT and
Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction which was recently launched for bosonic
field theories is extended to fermions. As fermion quantisation is not in terms
of measures, the scheme has to be mildly modified accordingly.
  We exemplify the scheme for free fermions both for compact and non-compact
spatial topologies respectively (i.e. with and without IR cut-off) and
demonstrate that the convenient Dirichlet or Shannon coarse graining kernels
recently advertised in a companion paper lead to a manifestly doubler free
flow. 

#### **Hamiltonian renormalisation VI: Parametrised field theory on the cylinder**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann, E. -A. Zwicknagel
 - **Subjects:** ['gr-qc', 'hep-lat', 'hep-th']
 - **Arxiv link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08290v1)
 - **Abstract**
 Hamiltonian Renormalisation, as defined within this series of works, was
derived from covariant Wilson renormalisation via Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction. As such it directly applies to QFT with a true (physical)
Hamiltonian bounded from below. The validity of the scheme was positively
tested for free QFT in any dimension with or without Abelian gauge symmetries
of Yang-Mills type.
  The aim of this Hamiltonian renormalisation scheme is to remove quantisation
ambiguities of Hamiltonians in interacting QFT that remain even after UV and IR
regulators are removed as it happens in highly non-linear QFT such as quantum
gravity. While not derived for that case, the renormalisation flow formulae can
without change also be applied to QFT without a single true Hamiltonian but
rather an infinite number of Hamiltonian constraints. Then a central question
is how the constraint algebra reacts to the renormalisation flow.
  This question should ultimately be addressed in quantum gravity. Before one
considers this interacting, constrained QFT it is well motivated to consider a
free, constrained QFT where the fixed point is explicitly known. In this paper
we therefore address the case of parametrised field theory for which the
quantum constraint algebra coincides simultaneously with the hypersurface
deformation algebra of quantum gravity (or any other generally covariant
theory) and the Virasoro algebra of free, closed, bosonic string theory or
other CFT to which the results of this paper apply verbatim.
  The central result of our investigation is that finite resolution
(discretised) constraint algebras {\it must not close} and that anomaly
freeness of the continuum algebra is encoded in the convergence behaviour of
the renormalisation flow.
