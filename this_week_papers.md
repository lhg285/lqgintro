#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum Gravity Effect in Binary Black Hole Merger**
 - **Authors:** Parthasarathi Majumdar
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09391](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09391)
 - **Abstract**
 We present a semi-rigorous justification of Bekenstein's Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics applicable to a universe with black holes present, based on a generic quantum gravity formulation of a black hole spacetime, where the bulk Hamiltonian constraint plays a central role. Specializing to Loop Quantum Gravity, and considering the inspiral and post-ringdown stages of binary black hole merger into a remnant black hole, we show that the Generalized Second Law implies a lower bound on the non-perturbative LQG correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black hole entropy. This lower bound itself is expressed as a function of the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula for entropy. Using the analyses of LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data recently performed to verify the Hawking Area Theorem for binary black hole merger, this Loop Quantum Gravity-induced lower bound is shown to be entirely consistent with the data. 

#### **Alleviation of anomalies from the non-oscillatory vacuum in loop quantum  cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Mercedes Martín-Benito, Rita B. Neves, Javier Olmedo
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09599](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09599)
 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate observational signatures of a primordial power spectrum with exponential infrared suppression, motivated by the choice of a non-oscillatory vacuum in a bouncing and inflationary geometry within Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We leave the parameter that defines the scale at which suppression occurs free and perform a Bayesian analysis, comparing with CMB data. The data shows a preference for some of the suppression to be within the observable window. Guided by this analysis, we choose concrete illustrative values for this parameter. We show that the model affects only slightly the parity anomaly, but it is capable of alleviating the lensing and power suppression anomalies.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Gödel's undecidability theorems and the search for a theory of  everything**
 - **Authors:** Claus Kiefer
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07331)
 - **Abstract**
 I investigate the question whether G\"odel's undecidability theorems play a crucial role in the search for a unified theory of physics. I conclude that unless the structure of space-time is fundamentally discrete we can never decide whether a given theory is the final one or not. This is relevant for both canonical quantum gravity and string theory.
