#### **Categorical generalization of MacDowell Mansouri gravity coupled to Kalb  Ramond fields**
 - **Authors:** Miguel A. Oliveira
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05115](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05115)
 - **Abstract**
 In this work we generalize the MacDowell-Mansouri theory of gravity using strict 2-groups. To achieve this, we construct the categorical generalization of the ISO(4,1) group, which we call the de Sitter 2-group. We then proceed to generalize the MacDowell-Mansouri theory in two different ways. First, as a Yang-Mills-type theory, where the symmetry is explicitly broken to obtain an Einstein-Cartan theory coupled to Kalb-Ramond fields. And second, by using the categorical generalization of the BF theory, called 2-BF theory, which after the addition of some symmetry breaking and constraint terms gives the same Einstein-Cartan theory coupled to Kalb-Ramond fields plus some extra topological terms.

#### **Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in  gravity's rainbow**
 - **Authors:** B. Hamil, B. C. Lütfüoğlu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00960](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00960)
 - **Abstract**
 According to some quantum gravity models, Lorentz invariance can be violated in the Planck energy scale. With this motivation, we analyze the thermal quantities and the stability of Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in gravity's rainbow formalism. To do that, we consider the rainbow functions which are motivated by loop quantum gravity and gamma-ray bursts, and we derive Hawking temperature, specific heat, entropy and the equation of state function. We observe that the presence the quintessence matter field and rainbow gravity affect the stability of the black hole.
