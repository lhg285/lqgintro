 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the quantum effective dynamics of Papapetrou spacetime by using methods from loop quantum gravity. The Papapetrou spacetime is an extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with an extra coupled anti-scalar field. By solving the equations of motion generated by the Hamiltonian constraint for Papapetrou spacetime, we can construct the quantum effective metric. The resulting effective metric for the quantum-corrected Papapetrou spacetime demonstrates the quantum effects inevitably give rise to a new wormhole throat while the classical wormhole throat disappear in the case of extremely small mass.
