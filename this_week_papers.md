 - **Abstract**
 While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.
