 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we show that quantum state discrimination can be modified due to a change in the underlying topology of a system. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that the quantum state discrimination of systems with underlying discrete topology differs from that of systems with underlying continuous topology. Such changes in the topology of a spacetime can occur in certain quantum gravity approaches. In fact, all approaches to quantum gravity can be classified into two types: those with underlying continuous topology (such as string theory) and those with an underlying discrete topology (such as loop quantum gravity). We demonstrate that the topology of these two types of quantum gravity approaches has different effects on the quantum state discrimination of low-energy quantum systems. We also show that any modification of quantum mechanics, which does not change the underlying topology, does not modify quantum state discrimination.
