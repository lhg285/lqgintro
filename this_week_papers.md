 - **Authors:** Tim Meier, Eggon Viana
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We construct twisted noncommutative gauge theories on twistor space and show that they are equivalent to four-dimensional twist-noncommutative gauge theories. In particular, we study twists of the Poincaré algebra. We explain how such a twist leads to twisted noncommutative twistor space and how to construct noncommutative versions of BF theory and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on noncommutative supertwistor space. We show how those theories are equivalent to noncommutative versions of Yang-Mills theory and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, respectively.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Critical collapse of a massive scalar field in semi-classical loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Li-Jie Xin, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate critical phenomena during the gravitational collapse of a massive scalar field under two distinct semi-classical loop quantum gravity (LQG) approaches within spherical symmetry. Numerical simulations reveal that the massive scalar field in both semi-classical frameworks exhibits two distinct types of critical behavior, consistent with the classical scenario. When the scalar field's mass parameter is small, type II critical phenomena emerge, with the resulting echoing periods and critical exponents precisely matching those obtained in general relativity. In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass. These findings suggest that semi-classical corrections from LQG have a negligible impact on the dynamics of critical collapse.
