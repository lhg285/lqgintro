#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Static and stationary loop quantum black bounces**
 - **Authors:** C.R. Muniz, G. Alencar, M.S. Cunha, Gonzalo J. Olmo
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We explore a static and stationary black bounce geometry inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), focusing on how LQG corrections and regularization parameters affect its properties. Building on the spherically symmetric and static black hole solution from \cite{Kelly:2020uwj}, we trace its origin to Non-Linear Electrodynamics (NED) with electric and magnetic charges and check the energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC). By extending the geometry using the Simpson-Visser procedure, we construct a black hole-wormhole bounce structure, influenced by LQG parameters. We analyze the horizon structure to constrain parameters for black holes and wormholes, and examine curvature and new sources including a phantom-type scalar field to ensure spacetime regularity and adherence to energy conditions. Thermodynamic properties are also studied, revealing the existence of remnants and phase transitions. Additionally, we derive a rotating black bounce solution, verifying its regularity, and putting forward that the spherical bouncing surface turns into an ellipsoid with no ring singularity. Finally, we find that increasing the LQG parameter leads to smaller ergospheres and reduced shadows, with potential implications for observational astrophysics and quantum gravitational signatures.
