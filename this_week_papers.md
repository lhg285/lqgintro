 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we will investigate the consequences of loop quantum gravitational modifications on the formation of naked singularities. The loop quantum gravitational effects will be incorporated in the collapsing system using gravity's rainbow. This will be done by using rainbow functions, which are constructed from loop quantum gravitational modifications to the energy momentum dispersion. It will be observed that this modification will prevent the formation of naked singularity. Thus, such a modification can ensures that the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis will hold for any collapsing system.
