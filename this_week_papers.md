#### **Title:
          Bell states for fermions in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Hanno Sahlmann, Martin Zeiß
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Fermion fields are fundamental for the description of nature and also fit very naturally into the framework of loop quantum gravity. Motivated partially by proposals to use gravitationally mediated entanglement of matter as a witness for the quantum nature of gravity, we investigate how such entanglement can be defined and investigated in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we ask how a pair of fermions in a Bell state could be described in loop quantum, gravity. We demonstrate that the notion of fermionic entanglement in loop quantum gravity is subtle, by showing that some potential ways to define it fail. We then investigate a kinematical observable involving both, fermionic and gravitational degrees of freedom, the component of the fermion spin normal to a surface. We study its properties, and compare it to the standard operator for components of spin in a given direction in quantum mechanics. Using these normal components of spin, we define a kinematical observable that measures the correlation between space-like separated fermions which closely mirrors the CHSH observable. Finally, we exhibit states of the fermions coupled to quantum geometry that violate the Bell-CHSH inequality.

#### **Title:
          Hamiltonian analysis of an Effective action coupled to the Palatini action in 4 dimensions**
 - **Authors:** Ricardo Escobedo, Roberto Santos-Silva, Claudia Moreno, Rafael Hernández-Jiménez
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We carry out the canonical analysis of the coupling of a $4$-dimensional effective action that arises from a dimensional reduction of a $7$-dimensional BF theory to the Palatini action in $4$-dimensions with cosmological constant, focusing on homogeneity and isotropy in all involved fields. We employ Ostrogradsky's methodology because of the presence of second time derivatives. Through the analysis of consistency conditions, we identify three distinct and consistent possibilities. In all these scenarios, we explore the solution of second-class constraints in terms of pairs of canonical variables. Similarly, Hamiltonian analysis is performed only for the $4$-dimensional effective theory. The second-class constraints are solved in terms of canonical coordinates, revealing that this formulation aligns with one of the viable scenarios explored in the coupling to the $4$-dimensional Palatini action, entailing that the $4$-dimensional effective action nullifies gravity.

#### **Title:
          Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Black Hole with Quintessential Dark Energy and a String Clouds: Geodesics, Perturbative Dynamics, and Thermal Properties**
 - **Authors:** Faizuddin Ahmed, Ahmad Al-Badawi, İzzet Sakallı
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field (QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.
