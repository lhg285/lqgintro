#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Perfect discretizations as a gateway to one-loop partition functions for  4D gravity**
 - **Authors:** Seth K. Asante, Bianca Dittrich
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03307](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03307)
 - **Abstract**
 Lattice actions and amplitudes that perfectly mirror continuum physics are known as perfect discretizations. Such perfect discretizations naturally preserve the symmetries of the continuum. This is a key concern for general relativity, where diffeomorphism symmetry and dynamics are deeply connected, and diffeomorphisms play a crucial role in quantization. In this work we construct for the first time a perfect discretizations for four-dimensional linearized gravity. We show how the perfect discretizations do lead to a straightforward construction of the one-loop quantum corrections for manifolds with boundary. This will also illustrate, that for manifolds with boundaries, gauge modes that affect the boundary, need to be taken into account for the computation of the one-loop correction. This work provides therefore an evaluation of the boundary action for the diffeomorphism modes for a general class of backgrounds.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum speed limit and stability of coherent states in quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Klaus Liegener, Łukasz Rudnicki
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01597)
 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing the program of expectation values in coherent states and its recently developed algorithmic tools, this letter investigates the dynamical properties of cosmological coherent states for Loop Quantum Gravity. To this end, the Quantum Speed Limit is adapted to Quantum Gravity, yielding necessary consistency checks for any proposal of stable families of states. To showcase the strength of the developed tools, they are applied to a prominent model: the Euclidean part of the quantum scalar constraint. We report the variance of this constraint evaluated on a family of coherent states showing that, for short times, this family passes the Quantum Speed Limit test, allowing the transition from one coherent state to another one.
