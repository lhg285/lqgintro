#### **The R-Matrix in 3d Topological BF Theory**
 - **Authors:** Nanna Havn Aamand
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15833)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper I study Wilson line operators in a certain type of split Chern-Simons theory on a manifold with boundaries. The resulting gauge theory is a 3d topological BF theory equivalent to a topologically twisted 3d $\mathcal N=4$ theory. I show that this theory realises solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation all orders in perturbation theory as the expectation value of crossing Wilson lines.

#### **Dimensional Reduction of the $S^3$/WZW Duality**
 - **Authors:** Kenta Suzuki, Yusuke Taki
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13852)
 - **Abstract**
 Recently proposed duality relates the critical level limit $\hat{k} \to -2$ of $SU(2)_{\hat{k}}$ WZW models to a classical three-dimensional Einstein gravity on a sphere. In this paper, we propose a dimensional reduced version of this duality. The gravity side is reduced to a Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity on $S^2$ with a non-standard boundary term, or a BF theory with $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. At least in low temperature limit, these two-dimensional gravity theories completely capture the original three-dimensional gravity effect. The CFT side is reduced to a certain complex Liouville quantum mechanics (LQM) with $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Our proposal gives an interesting example of a holography without boundary. We also discuss a higher-spin generalization with $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry.

#### **Lorentzian wormhole in the framework of loop quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Rikpratik Sengupta, Shounak Ghosh, Mehedi Kalam
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12527)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we construct a traversable static Lorentzian wormhole in the effective scenario of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), where the field equations are modified due to the ultraviolet (UV) corrections introduced at large space-time curvatures. A stable wormhole can be constructed in the effective scenario without the violation of Null energy condition (NEC) by physical matter at the throat. The NEC is effectively violated due to the corrections in the field equations from LQC, resolving the Weyl curvature singularity at the throat. However, the physical matter does violate the Strong energy condition (SEC), suggesting the interesting possibility that dark energy can be harnessed into a wormhole. A possible explanation for this is the presence of inherent pressure isotropy in the UV-corrected field equations (discussed and compared to braneworld wormholes in the discussion). No additional exotic ingredient (violating NEC) is required, avoiding quantum instabilities. The tidal forces at the throat do not diverge and also the throat is found to be stable. The wormhole features an attractive geometry. LQC can resolve both types of curvature singularities appearing at the black hole center and wormhole throat, without exotic matter.
