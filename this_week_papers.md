#### **Title:
          Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial**
 - **Authors:** Ali Kaya

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.

#### **Title:
          Quasinormal Frequencies of Fields with Various Spin in the Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Model of Black Holes**
 - **Authors:** Milena Skvortsova
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 A recent development involves an intriguing model of a quantum-corrected black hole, established through the application of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model within loop quantum cosmology [Lewandowski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023) 10, 101501]. Employing both time-domain integration and the WKB approach, we compute the quasinormal frequencies for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino perturbations in these quantum-corrected black holes. Our analysis reveals that while the real oscillation frequencies undergo only minor adjustments due to the quantum parameter, the damping rate experiences a significant decrease as a result of its influence. We also deduce the analytic formula for quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and show that the correspondence between the null geodesics and eikoanl quasinormal modes holds in this case.
