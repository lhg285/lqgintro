 - **Abstract**
 We develop the regular black hole solutions recently proposed in arXiv:2109.05974 by incorporating the 1-loop quantum correction to the Newton potential as well as a time delay between an observer at the regular center and that at infinity. We define the maximal time delay between the center and the infinity by scanning the mass of black holes such that the sub-Planckian feature of Kretschmann scalar curvature is preserved during the whole process of evaporation. We also compare the distinct behavior of Kretschmann curvature for black holes with an asymptotically Minkowski core and those with an asymptotically de-Sitter core, including Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We expect that this sort of regular black holes may provide more information about the construction of effective metric for Planck stars.
