 - **Abstract**
 The statistical mechanical calculation of the thermodynamical properties of higher-dimensional non-rotating isolated horizons is studied in the loop quantum gravity framework. By employing the Hawking temperature and horizon mass of isolated horizons as physical input, the microcanonical ensemble associated with the system are well established. As a result, the black hole entropy and other thermodynamical quantities can be computed and consistent with well known Hawking's semiclassical analysis. Moreover, the value of the Immirzi parameter of higher-dimensional loop quantum gravity is also obtained.
