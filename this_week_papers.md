#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Probing the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole using congruences:  LQG vs GUP**
 - **Authors:** Saeed Rastgoo, Saurya Das
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03799](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03799)
 - **Abstract**
 We review, as well as provide some new results regarding the study of the structure of spacetime and the singularity in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole in both loop quantum gravity and generalized uncertainty principle approaches, using congruences and their associated expansion scalar and the Raychaudhuri equation. We reaffirm previous results that in loop quantum gravity, in all three major schemes of polymer quantization, the expansion scalar, Raychaudhuri equation and the Kretschmann scalar remain finite everywhere in the interior. In the context of the generalized uncertainty principle, we show that only two of the four models we study lead to similar results. These two models have the property that their algebra is modified by configuration variables rather than the momenta. 

#### **Aspects of self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity**
 - **Authors:** Pratik Chattopadhyay
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03675](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03675)
 - **Abstract**
 In this thesis, we study the all same helicity loop amplitudes in self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity. These amplitudes have long been conjectured to be interpreted as an anomaly and are recently linked to the UV divergence of two-loop quantum gravity. In the first part of the thesis, we study the loop amplitudes in self-dual Yang-Mills. We show that the four point one-loop amplitude can be reduced to a computation of shifts, which strongly suggests a case for an anomaly interpretation. We next propose a new formula for the one-loop amplitudes at all multiplicity, in terms of the Berends-Giele currents connected by an effective propagator. We prove the formula by observing that it readily implies the correct collinear properties. To demonstrate the validity of our formula, we do an explicit computation at 3, 4 and 5 points and reproduce the known results. The region momenta variables play an important role in our formula and thus it points to both the worldsheet and the momentum twistor interpretations. In the second part of the thesis, we study the one loop behaviour of chiral Einstein-Cartan gravity and the one-loop amplitudes in self-dual gravity.
