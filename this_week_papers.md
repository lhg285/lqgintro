#### **Effects of a Quantum or Classical Scalar Field on the Entanglement  Entropy of a Pair of Universes**
 - **Authors:** Samuel Barroso Bellido
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14736)
 - **Abstract**
 Using the formalism of the third quantization in canonical quantum gravity, the entropy of entanglement of a pair of universes created in the multiverse from the vacuum has lately been calculated. Here, we examine the differences between considering a scalar field as quantum or classical on the entanglement entropy of three different pairs: de-Sitter universes, flat stiff matter dominated universes, and closed universes with a scalar field. We find that the entanglement entropy is unchanged, zero, or dependent on the treatment of the scalar field, respectively. 

#### **Phase transitions in tensorial group field theories: Landau-Ginzburg  analysis of models with both local and non-local degrees of freedom**
 - **Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Daniele Oriti, Andreas G. A. Pithis, Johannes Thürigen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15336)
 - **Abstract**
 In the tensorial group field theory approach to quantum gravity, the theory is based on discrete building blocks and continuum spacetime is expected to emerge from their collective dynamics, possibly at criticality, via a phase transition. On a compact group of fixed volume this can be expected to be only possible in a large-volume or thermodynamic limit. Here we show how phase transitions are possible in TGFTs in two cases: a) considering the non-local group degrees of freedom on a non-compact Lie group instead of a compact one (or taking a large-volume limit of a compact group); b) in models including $\mathbb{R}$-valued local degrees of freedom (that can be interpreted as discrete scalar fields, often used in this context to provide a matter reference frame). After adapting the Landau-Ginzburg approach to this setting of mixed local/non-local degrees of freedom, we determine the critical dimension beyond which there is a Gaussian fixed point and a continuous phase transition which can be described by mean-field theory. This is an important step towards the realization of a phase transition to continuum spacetime in realistic TGFT models for quantum gravity. 

#### **Bulk area law for boundary entanglement in spin network states: entropy  corrections and horizon-like regions from volume correlations**
 - **Authors:** Goffredo Chirco, Eugenia Colafranceschi, Daniele Oriti
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15166)
 - **Abstract**
 For quantum gravity states associated to open spin network graphs, we study how the entanglement entropy of the boundary degrees of freedom (spins on open edges) is affected by the bulk data, specifically by its combinatorial structure and by the quantum correlations among intertwiner degrees of freedom. For a specific assignment of bulk edge spins and slightly entangled intertwiners, we recover the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (with a properly (discrete) geometric notion of area, thanks to the underlying quantum gravity formalism) and its corrections due to the entanglement entropy of the bulk state. We also show that the presence of a region with highly entangled intertwiners deforms the minimal-area surface, which is then prevented from entering that region when the entanglement entropy of the latter exceeds a certain bound. This entanglement-based mechanism leads thus to the formation of a black hole-like region in the bulk.

#### **Group quantization of the black hole minisuperspace**
 - **Authors:** Francesco Sartini
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13756)
 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of non trivial symmetries for black holes minisuperspaces has been recently pointed out. These Noether symmetries possess non null charges and hence map physical solutions to different ones. The symmetry group is isomorphic to the finite dimensional Poincar\'e group ISO(2,1), whose irreducible representations are well known. This structure is used to build a consistent quantum theory of black hole minisuperspace. This has, among others, the striking consequence of implying a continuous spectrum for the mass operator. Following loop quantum cosmology, we obtain a regularization scheme compatible with the symmetry structure. It is possible to study the evolution of coherent states following the classical trajectories in the low curvature regime. We show that this produces an effective metric where the singularity is replaced by a Killing horizon merging two asymptotically flat regions. The quantum correction comes from a fundamental discreteness of spacetime, and the uncertainty on the energy of the system. Remarkably the effective evolution of semiclassical states is described by an effective Hamiltonian, related to the original one through a canonical transformation.
