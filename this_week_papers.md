 - **Abstract**
 Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a theory which renders the Big Bang initial singularity into a quantum bounce, by means of short range repulsive quantum effects at the Planck scale. In this work, we are interested in reproducing the effective Friedmann equation of LQC, by considering a generic $f(R,P,Q)$ theory of gravity, where $R=g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci scalar, $P=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$, and $Q=R_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}R^{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ is the Kretschmann scalar. An order reduction technique allows us to work in $f(R,P,Q)$ theories which are perturbatively close to General Relativity, and to deduce a modified Friedmann equation in the reduced theory. Requiring that the modified Friedmann equation mimics the effective Friedmann equation of LQC, we are able to derive several functional forms of $f(R,P,Q)$. We discuss the necessary conditions to obtain viable bouncing cosmologies for the proposed effective actions of $f(R,P,Q)$ theory of gravity. 

#### **Let Loop Quantum Gravity and Affine Quantum Gravity Examine Each Other**
 - **Authors:** John R. Klauder
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 Loop Quantum Gravity is widely developed using canonical quantization in an effort to find the correct quantization for gravity. Affine quantization, which is like canonical quantization augmented bounded in one orientation, e.g., a strictly positive coordinate. We open discussion using canonical and affine quantizations for two simple problems so each procedure can be understood. That analysis opens a modest treatment of quantum gravity gleaned from some typical features that exhibit the profound differences between aspects of seeking the quantum treatment of Einstein's gravity.
