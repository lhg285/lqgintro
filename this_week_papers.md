 - **Abstract**
 This chapter focuses on the status of the implementation of the dynamics in the canonical version of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Concretely this means to provide a mathematical meaning of the quantum Einstein equations, sometimes called Wheeler-DeWitt equations, to give a physical interpretation and Hilbert space structure to its solutions and to construct a representation of the algebra of observables including a physical Hamiltonian. This is a structural overview intentionally skipping technical details.
