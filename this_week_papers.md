 - **Abstract**
 Defining a scale of $k$-modes of the quantum fluctuations during inflation through the dynamical horizon crossing condition $k = aH$ we go from the physical $t$ variable to $k$ variable and solve the equations of cosmological perturbations self consistently, with chaotic $\alpha$-attractor type potentials. This enables us to study the behaviour of $n_{s}$, $r$, $n_{h}$ and $N$ in the $k$-space. Comparison of our results in the low-$k$ regime with the Planck data puts constraints on the values of the $\alpha$ parameter through microscopic calculations. Both for the $E$-model and the $T$-model potentials, low values of $\alpha$ are experimentally favoured. For the $E$-model ($T$-model) the values of $\alpha<5$ ($\alpha<10$) are consistent with the Planck-2018 data in the $n_{s}$-$r$ plane at $95\%$ CL. The relevance of this study in the context of large scale structure of the universe is pointed out. 

#### Lorentz violating inflation and the Swampland

 - **Abstract**
 The swampland conjectures from String theory have had very interesting implications for cosmology and particularly for Inflation. It has been shown that the single field inflationary models in a GR based cosmology are in unavoidable tensions with these conjectures, while these single field models can still be consistent in certain non-trivial inflationary regimes. So it becomes interesting to see whether there is a way to overcome the issues of the swampland and single field inflation in an essentially GR based cosmology. We show that this can indeed be the case and for this, we consider a certain type of Lorentz violating inflationary scenario. We work out the swampland bounds for Lorentz violating inflationary models after which show that inflationary models which would have had otherwise serious tensions with these conjectures in a usual GR based scenario, can be very tranquil with the criterion in this regime. For this we take examples of Higgs inflation, radion gauge inflation and Spontaenous symmetry breaking inflation and show that the bounds imposed by the swampland on the Lorentz violating parameter can be easily satisfied in these models. 

#### Irreducible representations of simple Lie algebras by differential  operators

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a systematic method to construct arbitrary highest-weight modules, including arbitrary finite-dimensional representations, for any finite dimensional simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The Lie algebra generators are represented as first order differential operators in $\frac{1}{2} \left(\dim \mathfrak{g} - \text{rank} \, \mathfrak{g}\right) $ variables. All rising generators ${\bf e}$ are universal in the sense that they do not depend on representation, the weights enter (in a very simple way) only in the expressions for the lowering operators ${\bf f}$. We present explicit formulas of this kind for the simple root generators of all classical Lie algebras.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a large-$N$ bosonic quantum mechanical sigma-model with a spherical target space subject to disordered interactions, more colloquially known as the $p$-spin spherical model. Replica symmetry is broken at low temperatures and for sufficiently weak quantum fluctuations, which drives the system into a spin glass phase. The first half of this paper is dedicated to a discussion of this model's thermodynamics, with particular emphasis on the marginally stable spin glass. This phase exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry in the strong coupling regime, which dictates its thermodynamic properties. It is associated with an extensive number of nearby states in the free energy landscape. We discuss in detail an elegant approximate solution to the spin glass equations, which interpolates between the conformal regime and an ultraviolet-complete short distance solution. In the second half of this paper we explore the real-time dynamics of the model and uncover quantum chaos as measured by out-of-time-order four-point functions, both numerically and analytically. We find exponential Lyapunov growth, which intricately depends on the model's couplings and becomes strongest in the quantum critical regime. We emphasize that the spin glass phase also exhibits quantum chaos, albeit with parametrically smaller Lyapunov exponent than in the replica symmetric phase. An analytical calculation in the marginal spin glass phase suggest that this Lyapunov exponent vanishes in a particular infinite coupling limit. We comment on the potential meaning of these observations from the perspective of holography.
