 - **Abstract**
 Generalized entropy, that has been recently proposed, puts all the known and apparently different entropies like The Tsallis, the R\'{e}nyi, the Barrow, the Kaniadakis, the Sharma-Mittal and the loop quantum gravity entropy within a single umbrella. However, the microscopic origin of such generalized entropy as well as its relation to thermodynamic system(s) is not clear. In the present work, we will provide a microscopic thermodynamic explanation of generalized entropy(ies) from canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. It turns out that in both the canonical and grand-canonical descriptions, the generalized entropies can be interpreted as the statistical ensemble average of a series of microscopic quantity(ies) given by various powers of $\left(-k\ln{\rho}\right)^n$ (with $n$ being a positive integer and $\rho$ symbolizes the phase space density of the respective ensemble), along with a term representing the fluctuation of Hamiltonian and number of particles of the system under consideration (in case of canonical ensemble, the fluctuation on the particle number vanishes).
