 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel path integral formalism for Einstein's theory of gravitation from the viewpoint of optimal control theory. Despite its close relation to the well-known variational principles of physicists, optimal control turns out to be more general. Within this context, a Lagrangian different from the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is defined. Einstein field equations are recovered exactly with variations of the new action functional. The quantum theory is obtained using Ashtekar variables and the loop scalar product. By means of example, the tunneling process of a black hole into another black hole or into a white hole is investigated with a toy model.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Initial conditions of pre-inflation with Hilltop potential in loop  quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** M. Shahalam, Kuralay Yesmakhanova, Zhanar Umurzakhova
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of pre-inflation with Hilltop potential in the framework of loop quantum cosmology. The initial conditions of inflaton field at the quantum bounce is categorized into two classes, first one is dominated by kinetic energy and second one by potential energy. In both cases, the physically viable initial values of inflaton field at the bounce are obtained numerically that generate the desired slow-roll inflation and also sufficient number of $e$-folds. To be consistent with observations at least 60 $e$-folds are required. In case of kinetic energy dominated initial conditions of inflaton field at the bounce, the numerical evolution of the background prior to preheating is divided into three different regions: {\it bouncing, transition and slow-roll inflation} whereas bouncing and transition phases disappear in the potential energy dominated case but still slow-roll inflation is achieved. This is true in case of $p=4$ and $v=1 M_{Pl}$ of Hilltop potential. However for other cases, slow-roll inflation can not be obtained. Moreover, we study the phase space analysis for Hilltop potential and discuss the phase space trajectories under the chosen parameters.
