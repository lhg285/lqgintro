#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The Generalized Uncertainty Principle and Higher Dimensions: Linking  Black Holes and Elementary Particles**
 - **Authors:** B. J. Carr
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes play an important role in linking microphysics with macrophysics, with those of the Planck mass ($M_P \sim10^{-5}$g) featuring in any theory of quantum gravity. In particular, the Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence posits a smooth transition between the Compton wavelength ($R_C \propto 1/M$) below the Planck mass and the Schwarzschild radius ($R_{\rm S} \propto M$) above it. The duality between $R_{\rm C}$ and $R_{\rm S}$ implies a form of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and suggests that elementary particles may be sub-Planckian black holes. The simplest possibility is that the ADM mass has the form $M + \beta M_P^2/M$ for some constant $\beta$ and this model can be extended to charged and rotating black holes, clearly relevant to elementary particles. Another possibility is that sub-Planckian black holes may arise in loop quantum gravity and this explicitly links black holes and elementary particles. Higher dimensions may modify both proposals. If there are $n$ extra dimensions, all with the same compactification scale, one expects $R_{\rm S} \propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ below this scale but $R_{\rm C}$ depends on the form of the higher-dimensional wave-function. If it is spherically symmetric, then $R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1}$, so duality is broken and the Planck mass is reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity. If the wave-function is pancaked in the extra dimensions, $R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$ and so duality is preserved but the Planck mass is unchanged. 

#### **Geometry Transition in Spinfoams**
 - **Authors:** Marios Christodoulou, Fabio D'Ambrosio, Charalampos Theofilis
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12622)
 - **Abstract**
 We show how the fixed-spin asymptotics of the EPRL model can be used to perform the spin-sum for spin foam amplitudes defined on fixed two-complexes without interior faces and contracted with coherent spin-network states peaked on a discrete simplicial geometry with macroscopic areas. We work in the representation given in Ref. 1. We first rederive the latter in a different way suitable for our purposes. We then extend this representation to 2-complexes with a boundary and derive its relation to the coherent state representation. We give the measure providing the resolution of the identity for Thiemann's state in the twisted geometry parametrization. The above then permit us to put everything together with other results in the literature and show how the spin sum can be performed analytically for the regime of interest here. These results are relevant to analytic investigations regarding the transition of a black hole to a white hole geometry. In particular, this work gives detailed technique that was the basis of estimate for the black to white bounce appeared in Ref. 2. These results may also be relevant for applications of spinfoams to investigate the possibility of a 'big bounce'. 

#### **Corner symmetry and quantum geometry**
 - **Authors:** Laurent Freidel, Marc Geiller, Wolfgang Wieland
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 By virtue of the Noether theorems, the vast gauge redundancy of general relativity provides us with a rich algebra of boundary charges that generate physical symmetries. These charges are located at codimension-2 entangling surfaces called corners. The presence of non-trivial corner symmetries associated with any entangling cut provides stringent constraints on the theory's mathematical structure and a guide through quantization. This report reviews new and recent results for non-perturbative quantum gravity, which are natural consequences of this structure. First, we establish that the corner symmetry derived from the gauge principle encodes quantum entanglement across internal boundaries. We also explain how the quantum representation of the corner symmetry algebra provides us with a notion of quantum geometry. We then focus our discussion on the first-order formulation of gravity and show how many results obtained in the continuum connect naturally with previous results in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we show that it is possible to get, purely from quantization and without discretization, an area operator with discrete spectrum, which is covariant under local Lorentz symmetry. We emphasize that while loop gravity correctly captures some of the gravitational quantum numbers, it does not capture all of them, which points towards important directions for future developments. Finally, we discuss the understanding of the gravitational dynamics along null surfaces as a conservation of symmetry charges associated with a Carrollian fluid.
