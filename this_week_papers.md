#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Hamiltonian Theory: generalizations to higher dimensions, supersymmetry and modified gravity**
 - **Authors:** Norbert Bodendorfer, Konstantin Eder, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Loop quantum gravity in its Hamiltonian form relies on a connection formulation of the gravitational phase space with three key properties: 1.) a compact gauge group, 2.) real variables, and 3.) canonical Poisson brackets. In conjunction, these properties allow to construct a well defined kinematical quantization of the holonomy flux-algebra on top of which the remaining constraints can be implemented. While this idea has traditionally been mainly used for Einstein gravity, any gravitational theory with the above properties can be accommodated. In this paper, we are going to review three strands of work building on this observation, namely the study of higher-dimensional loop quantum gravity, supersymmetric extensions of loop quantum gravity, as well as the quantization of modified gravitational theories.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Gravitational quantum speed limit**
 - **Authors:** Nicola Pranzini, Lorenzo Maccone
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 While playing an important role in the foundations of quantum theory, Quantum Speed Limits (QSL) have no role in discussions about the search for quantum gravity. We fill this gap by analysing what QSL arises when superposing spherically symmetric masses in canonical quantum gravity. By this procedure, we find that the quantum mechanical Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds can be improved by superposing a spherically symmetric, static and asymptotically flat spacetime between states with different ADM energies and mass densities. We discuss the feasibility and significance of measuring times via these superpositions.
