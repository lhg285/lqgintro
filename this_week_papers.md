 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that in spacetime dimensions $d=2$ only the confined phase is generically possible. In $d=3,4$ the confined phase and a topological BF phase are both generic, while in $d=4$ a phase with a massless photon is also possible. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but not sufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.
