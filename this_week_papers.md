#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Graphical calculus of spin networks**
 - **Authors:** Emanuele Alesci, Ilkka Mäkinen, Jinsong Yang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00268](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00268)
 - **Abstract**
 Graphical techniques provide a very useful practical device for calculations involving the so-called spin network states, which encode the quantum degrees of freedom of spatial geometry in loop quantum gravity. Graphical calculus of SU(2), which has been originally introduced in the literature in order to deal with calculations arising from the coupling of angular momenta in quantum mechanics, can be used as a simple but powerful method for computing the action of various physically interesting operators in the spin network representation. Compared with conventional manipulation of algebraic expressions, calculations in the graphical approach are typically more convenient, concise and visually transparent. The goal of this chapter is to provide an accessible introduction to graphical methods in SU(2) recoupling theory and a brief description of their use as a tool for practical calculations in loop quantum gravity. We introduce the basics of the graphical formalism, and establish the representation of the elementary states and operators of loop quantum gravity in graphical form. Several example calculations are given to illustrate the use of the graphical techniques, including a computation of the matrix elements of a Hamiltonian constraint operator in the spin network basis. 

#### **Scalar curvature operator for loop quantum gravity on a cubical graph**
 - **Authors:** Ilkka Mäkinen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00271)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new operator representing the three-dimensional scalar curvature in loop quantum gravity. The operator is constructed by writing the Ricci scalar classically as a function of the Ashtekar variables and regularizing the resulting expression on a cubical spin network graph. While our construction does not apply to the entire Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, the proposed operator can be applied to concrete calculations in various approaches which are derived from the framework of full loop quantum gravity using states defined on cubical graphs.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Hamiltonian Theory: Dynamics**
 - **Authors:** Thomas Thiemann, Kristina Giesel
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18172](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18172)
 - **Abstract**
 This chapter focuses on the status of the implementation of the dynamics in the canonical version of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Concretely this means to provide a mathematical meaning of the quantum Einstein equations, sometimes called Wheeler-DeWitt equations, to give a physical interpretation and Hilbert space structure to its solutions and to construct a representation of the algebra of observables including a physical Hamiltonian. This is a structural overview intentionally skipping technical details.
