 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for multi-messenger signatures arising from quantum-corrected gravitational collapse within an extended Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) loop quantum gravity model incorporating perturbative asymmetries. By developing a consistent perturbation theory for non-spherical modes on the quantum-corrected spherically symmetric background, we resolve the fundamental tension between spherical symmetry assumptions and gravitational wave emission requirements. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum geometric effects naturally seed asymmetric perturbations during the bounce phase, leading to observable gravitational wave bursts with mass-dependent frequencies in the range $f_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{3}$ Hz and distinctive electromagnetic counterparts via quantum field effects in curved spacetime. Through self-consistent calculations based on the effective AOS framework, we compute the coupling between quantum bounce dynamics and perturbative modes, yielding gravitational wave strains $h \sim 10^{-23}$--$10^{-21}$ at 100 Mpc for primordial black holes with masses $M \sim 1$--$100$ $M_{\odot}$. The electromagnetic emission mechanism is analyzed through detailed calculations of dynamic Casimir effects and coherent field amplification in time-dependent quantum geometry. Our parameter sensitivity analysis reveals detection prospects that are critically dependent on primordial black hole abundance constraints, with realistic event rates of $\mc{R} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ within current observational limits. These results provide testable predictions for quantum gravity theories while extending previous work beyond spherical symmetry assumptions.

#### **Title:
          Quantum Gravity, de Sitter Space, and Normalizability**
 - **Authors:** Stephon Alexander, Heliudson Bernardo, Jacob Kuntzleman, Max Pezzelle
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of quantum gravity in de Sitter space.
