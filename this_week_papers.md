#### **Preliminary analyses on dynamics and thermodynamics of rotating regular  black holes**
 - **Authors:** Hao Yang, Chang-Jiang Yu, Yan-Gang Miao
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical and thermodynamic laws governing rotating regular black holes. By analyzing dynamical properties, i.e., the interaction between scalar particles and rotating regular black holes, we establish the criteria that determine whether such black holes satisfy the laws of thermodynamics or not. In addition, we provide the general form of conserved quantities related to rotating regular black holes, including the relevant flows associated with neutral scalar particles. Meanwhile, we reexamine the relationship between the third law of thermodynamics and weak cosmic censorship conjecture for rotating regular black holes. In accordance with the criteria mentioned above, we discuss the laws of thermodynamics for three models of rotating regular black holes: Rotating Hayward black holes, Kerr black-bounce solutions, and loop quantum gravity black holes. Our findings indicate that none of the three models satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. In particular, the first and third models fail to comply with the three laws of thermodynamics, while the second model satisfies only the second and third laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we attempt to rescue the laws of thermodynamics by modifying entropy or extending phase space. However, the two scenarios are not able to ensure the three laws of thermodynamics in the three models, which reveals an unusual property of rotating regular black holes. 

#### **On perturbative aspects of a nonminimal Lorentz-violating QED with  CPT-even dimension-5 terms**
 - **Authors:** T. Mariz, M. Melo, J. R. Nascimento, A. Yu. Petrov
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02876)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explicitly calculate the lower CPT-even one-loop quantum corrections in nonminimal Lorentz-violating spinor QED with all possible CPT-even dimension-5 operators.
