 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections $(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.
