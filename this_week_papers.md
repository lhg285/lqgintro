#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Singularities in loop quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald, Manuel Diaz, Erick I. Duque
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Quantum effects are expected to modify the cosmological dynamics of the early universe while maintaining some (potentially discrete) notion of space-time structure. In one approach, loop quantum cosmology, current models are shown here to either be incompatible with a consistent space-time structure, or to have physical singularities. The latter happens in spite of a non-zero scale factor in the isotropic background dynamics. A new effective Friedmann equation shows that a bounce is obtained at sub-Planckian densities, preceded by a physical singularity at infinite scale factor that resembles a time-reversed big rip. The entire phase is accompanied by rapid changes of the Hubble radius. In addition, a new version of perturbative inhomogeneity in loop quantum cosmology is introduced that maintains a consistent space-time structure and has a non-singular background dynamics.
