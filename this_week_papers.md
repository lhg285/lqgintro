#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Loop quantum black hole**
 - **Authors:** Xiangdong Zhang

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decades, progress on the quantization of black holes using techniques developed in loop quantum cosmology has received increasing attention. Due to the quantum geometry effect, the resulting quantum corrected black hole is free of singularity. The quantization scheme can be roughly divided into four types, that is 1. $\mu_0$-scheme, 2. $\bar{\mu}$-scheme, 3. generalized $\mu_0$-scheme, 4. quantum collapsing model. This paper provides an introduction of the loop quantum black hole models and a summary of the progress made in this field, as well as the quantum effective dynamics and physical applications of these models. 

#### **The instability of the inner horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole**

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the stability of the inner horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole which is proposed in loop quantum gravity as the exterior of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder and Swiss Cheese models. It is shown that the flux and energy density of a test scalar field measured by free-falling observers are both divergent near the Cauchy horizon. By considering the generalized Dray-'t Hooft-Redmond relation which is independent of the field equation, we find that the mass inflation always happens and the scalar curvature and Kretschmann scalar are also divergent on the inner horizon. These suggest that the inner horizon is unstable and will probably turn into a null singularity. The results support the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, this also implies that the quantum corrected model may not be the definitive endpoint as a regular black hole. Besides, it further proposes that any possible observable astronomical phenomenon which depends on the existence of the inner horizon of the black hole is not reliable.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The Quantum Waves of Minkowski Spacetime And The Minimal Acceleration  From Precanonical Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** I.V. Kanatchikov
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08738](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08738)
 - **Abstract**
 We construct the simplest solutions of the previously obtained precanonical Schr\"odinger equation for quantum gravity, which correspond to the plane waves on the spin connection bundle and reproduce the Minkowski spacetime on average. Quantum fluctuations lead to the emergence of the minimal acceleration $a_0$ related to the range of the Yukawa modes in the fibers of the spin connection bundle. This minimal acceleration is proportional to the square root of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ generated by the operator re-ordering in the precanonical Schr\"odinger equation. Thus the mysterious connection between the minimal acceleration $a_0$ in the dynamics of galaxies as described by Milgrom's MOND and the cosmological constant emerges as an elementary effect of precanonical quantum gravity. We also argue that the observable values of $a_0$ and $\Lambda$ can be obtained when the scale of the parameter $\varkappa$ introduced by precanonical quantization is subnuclear, in agreement with the previously established connection between the scale of $\varkappa$ and the mass gap in quantum SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.
