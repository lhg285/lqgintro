 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional gravity is a topological field theory, which can be quantized as the Ponzano-Regge state-sum model built from the $\{3nj\}$-symbols of the recoupling of the $\SU(2)$ representations, in which spins are interpreted as quantized edge lengths in Planck units. It describes the flat spacetime as gluing of three-dimensional cells with a fixed boundary metric encoding length scale. In this paper, we revisit the Ponzano-Regge model formulated in terms of spinors and rewrite the quantum geometry of 3D cells with holomorphic recoupling symbols. These symbols, known as Schwinger's generating function for the $\{6j\}$-symbols, are simply the squared inverse of the partition function of the 2D Ising model living on the boundary of the 3D cells. They can furthermore be interpreted, in their critical regime, as scale-invariant basic elements of geometry. We show how to glue them together into a discrete topological quantum field theory. This reformulation of the path integral for 3D quantum gravity, with a rich pole structure of the elementary building blocks, opens a new door toward the study of phase transitions and continuum limits in 3D quantum gravity, and offers a new twist on the construction of a duality between 3D quantum gravity and a 2d conformal theory.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Towards anisotropic cosmology in group field theory**
 - **Authors:** Andrea Calcinari, Steffen Gielen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 In cosmological group field theory (GFT) models for quantum gravity coupled to a massless scalar field the total volume, seen as a function of the scalar field, follows the classical Friedmann dynamics of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe at low energies while resolving the Big Bang singularity at high energies. An open question is how to generalise these results to other homogeneous cosmologies. Here we take the first steps towards studying anisotropic Bianchi models in GFT, based on the introduction of a new anisotropy observable analogous to the $\beta$ variables in Misner's parametrisation. In a classical Bianchi I spacetime, $\beta$ behaves as a massless scalar field and can be used as a (gravitational) relational clock. We construct a GFT model for which in an expanding Universe $\beta$ initially behaves like its classical analogue before "decaying" showing a previously studied isotropisation. We support numerical results in GFT by analytical approximations in a toy model. One possible outcome of our work is a definition of relational dynamics in GFT that does not require matter.
