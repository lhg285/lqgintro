#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **On the fate of quantum black holes**
 - **Authors:** Viqar Husain, Jarod George Kelly, Robert Santacruz, Edward Wilson-Ewing
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04238)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the quantum dynamics of the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi space-times using a polymer quantization prescription based on loop quantum cosmology that incorporates fundamental discreteness. By solving an effective equation derived from this quantization, we find analytical solutions for the Oppenheimer-Snyder and thin-shell collapse models, and numerical solutions for a variety of asymptotically flat collapsing dust profiles. Our study (i) tracks the formation, evolution and disappearance of dynamical horizons, (ii) shows that matter undergoes a non-singular bounce that results in an outgoing shock wave, (iii) determines black hole lifetime to be proportional to the square its mass, and (iv) provides a conformal diagram that substantially modifies the standard "information loss" picture by resolving the singularity and replacing the event horizon by transient apparent horizons.

#### Spin foam related papers

#### **From spin foams to area metric dynamics to gravitons**
 - **Authors:** Bianca Dittrich, Athanasios Kogios
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02409)
 - **Abstract**
 Although spin foams arose as quantizations of the length metric degrees of freedom, the quantum configuration space is rather based on areas as more fundamental variables. This is also highlighted by the semi-classical limit of four-dimensional spin foam models, which is described by the Area Regge action. Despite its central importance to spin foams the dynamics encoded by the Area Regge action is only poorly understood, in particular in the continuum limit. We perform here a systematic investigation of the dynamics defined by the Area Regge action on a regular centrally subdivided hypercubical lattice. This choice of lattice avoids many problems of the non-subdivided hypercubical lattice, for which the Area Regge action is singular. The regularity of the lattice allows to extract the continuum limit and its corrections, order by order in the lattice constant. We show that, contrary to widespread expectations which arose from the so-called flatness problem of spin foams, the continuum limit of the Area Regge action does describe to leading order the same graviton dynamics as general relativity. The next-to-leading order correction to the effective action for the length metric is of second order in the lattice constant, and is given by a quadratic term in the Weyl curvature tensor. This correction can be understood to originate from an underlying dynamics of area metrics. This suggests that the continuum limit of spin foam dynamics does lead to massless gravitons, and that the leading order quantum corrections can be understood to emerge from a generalization of the configuration space from length to area metrics.
