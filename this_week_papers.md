 - **Abstract**
 Numerical methods in spin-foam models have significantly advanced in the last few years, yet challenges remain in efficiently extracting results for amplitudes with many quantum degrees of freedom. In this paper we sketch a proposal for a ``hybrid algorithm'' that would use both the full quantum amplitude and its asymptotic approximation in the relevant regimes. As a first step towards the algorithm, we derive a new representation of the partition function where each spin-foam vertex possesses its own coherent data, such that it can be individually asymptotically approximated. We do this through the implementation of gluing constraints between vertices, which we study numerically. We further derive an asymptotic expression for the constraints for arbitrary boundary data, including data for which there are no critical points. From this new representation we conjecture an intermediate quasi-geometric spin-foam regime describing a superposition of semi-classical vertices glued in a non-matching way via the gluing constraints.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **On a close relationship between the dressed metric and the hybrid  approach to perturbations in effective loop quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Bao-Fei Li, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12434)
 - **Abstract**
 The dressed metric and the hybrid approach to perturbations are the two main approaches to capture the effects of quantum geometry in the primordial power spectrum in loop quantum cosmology. Both consider Fock quantized perturbations over a loop quantized background and result in very similar predictions except for the modes which exit the horizon in the effective spacetime in the Planck regime. Understanding precise relationship between both approaches has so far remained obscured due to differences in construction and technical assumptions. We explore this issue at the classical and effective spacetime level for linear perturbations, ignoring backreaction, which is the level at which practical computations of the power spectrum in both of the approaches have so far been performed. We first show that at the classical level both the approaches lead to the same Hamiltonian up to the second order in perturbations and result in the same classical mass functions in the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation on the physical solutions. At the effective spacetime level, the difference in phenomenological predictions between the two approaches in the Planck regime can be traced to whether one uses the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable $Q_{\vec k}$ (the dressed metric approach) or its rescaled version $\nu_{\vec k}=aQ_{\vec k}$ (the hybrid approach) to write the Hamiltonian of the perturbations, and associated polymerization ambiguities. It turns out that if in the dressed metric approach one chooses to work with $\nu_{\vec{k}}$, the effective mass function can be written exactly as in the hybrid approach, thus leading to identical phenomenological predictions in all regimes. Our results explicitly show that the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches for linear perturbations, at a practical computational level, can be seen as two sides of the same coin.
