#### **A high-performance code for EPRL spin foam amplitudes**
 - **Authors:** Francesco Gozzini

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13952)
 - **Abstract**
 We present $\mathtt{\text{sl2cfoam-next}}$, a high-performance software library for computing Lorentzian EPRL spin foam amplitudes. The library improves on previous codes by many orders of magnitude in single-core performance, can be parallelized on a large number of CPUs and on the GPU, and can be used interactively. We describe the techniques used in the code and provide many usage examples. As first applications, we use $\mathtt{\text{sl2cfoam-next}}$ to complete the numerical test of the Lorentzian single-vertex asymptotics and to confirm the presence of the "flatness problem" of spin foam models in the BF and EPRL cases.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Non-oscillating vacuum states and the quantum homogeneity and isotropy  hypothesis in Loop Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Beatriz Elizaga Navascués, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Santiago Prado
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11054](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11054)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the compatibility of the quantum homogeneitiy and isotropy hypothesis (QHIH), proposed by Ashtekar and Gupt to restrict the choice of vacuum state for the cosmological perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), with the requirement that the selected vacuum should lead to a power spectrum that does not oscillate. We inspect in close detail the procedure that these authors followed to construct a set of states satisfying the QHIH, and how a preferred vacuum can be determined within this set. We find a step that is not univocally specified in this procedure, in relation with the replacement of the set of states that was originally allowed by the QHIH with an alternative set that is more manageable. In fact, the first of these sets does not contain the state that has been used in most of the implementations of the QHIH to the analysis of the power spectrum of the perturbations in LQC. We focus our attention on the original set picked out by the QHIH and investigate whether some of its elements may display a non-oscillatory behavior. We show that, to the extent to which the techniques used in this paper apply, this possibility is feasible. Thus, the two aforementioned criteria for the physical restriction of the vacuum state in LQC are compatible with each other and not exclusive.
