 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we theoretically investigate light deflection in the weak and strong field regimes for two regular spacetimes with corrections from loop quantum gravity. We treat analytically the expansions for both limits and use them as a basis for investigating gravitational lensing observables. We analyze and provide reasonable values for observables related to the second model that observational tools may be able to detect.
