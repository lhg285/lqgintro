 - **Abstract**
 In this article we continue the work on translating elements of the perturbative quantum field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime into the background independent framework of Loop Quantum Gravity. We present the construction of r-Fock measures for $SU(N)$ gauge theories and provide a relation between these new r-Fock measures and the difeomorphism invariant measure used in loop quantum gravity.
