 - **Abstract**
 We provide a covariant framework to study singularity-free Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes with effective corrections motivated by loop quantum gravity. We show that, as in general relativity, physically reasonable energy distributions lead to a contraction of the dust shells. However, quantum-gravity effects eventually stop the collapse, the dust smoothly bounces back, and no gravitational singularity is generated. This model is constructed by deforming the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity with the condition that the hypersurface deformation algebra is closed. In addition, under the gauge transformations generated by the deformed constraints, the structure function of the algebra changes adequately, so that it can be interpreted as the inverse spatial metric. Therefore, the model is completely covariant in the sense that gauge transformations in phase space simply correspond to coordinate changes in spacetime. However, in the construction of the metric, we point out a specific freedom of considering a conformal factor, which we use to obtain a family of singularity-free spacetimes associated to the modified model.
