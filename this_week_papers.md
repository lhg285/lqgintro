#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Spinfoams, $γ$-duality and parity violation in primordial  gravitational waves**
 - **Authors:** Eugenio Bianchi, Monica Rincon-Ramirez
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06053)
 - **Abstract**
 The Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ appears as a coupling constant in the spinfoam dynamics of loop quantum gravity and can be understood as a measure of gravitational parity violation via a duality rotation. We investigate an effective field theory for gravity and a scalar field, with dynamics given by a $\gamma$-dual action obtained via a duality rotation of a parity-non-violating one. The resulting relation between the coupling constants of parity-even and parity-odd higher-curvature terms is determined by $\gamma$, opening the possibility of its measurement in the semiclassical regime. For a choice of $\gamma$-dual effective action, we study cosmic inflation and show that the observation of a primordial tensor polarization, together with the tensor tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, provides a measurement of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and, therefore, of the scale of discreteness of the quantum geometry of space.

#### **A Monte Carlo algorithm for spin foam intertwiners**
 - **Authors:** Sebastian Steinhaus
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04836)
 - **Abstract**
 Monte Carlo algorithms are barely considered in spin foam quantum gravity. Due to the quantum nature of spin foam amplitudes one cannot readily apply them, and the present sign problem is a threat to convergence and thus efficiency. Yet, ultimately the severity of the sign problem in spin foams is not known. In this article we propose a new probability distribution for coherent (boundary) intertwiners, which we use to define a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply this algorithm to the SU(2) coherent vertex amplitude for various Regge-type boundary data and find convergent, accurate results at far lower costs than the explicit calculation. The resources are instead used to increase the size of boundary spins, bridging the gap to the asymptotic formulae. While the sign problem is not solved, it is under control in the vast majority of cases. We close by discussing how this algorithm can be extended to larger triangulations with boundary and 4d Lorentzian spin foam models. More speculatively, we discuss how this algorithm can be used to sample (Regge-geometric) bulk intertwiners.
