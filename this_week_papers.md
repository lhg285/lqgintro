#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Comment on "Towards a quantum notion of covariance in spherically  symmetric loop quantum gravity"**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06049)
 - **Abstract**
 A recent paper promises new constructions that may make it possible to achieve covariance in spherically symmetric models of loop quantum gravity. This claim is contrary to the discovery of several stubborn obstacles to covariance uncovered in the same models during the last few years. As the authors point out in their abstract, new progress is supposedly possible if one takes into account crucial features of a certain partial Abelianization of the gauge transformations of spherically symmetric gravity, published by the same authors. In canonical form, these gauge transformations are given by hypersurface deformations. A closer inspection of the technical calculations shows that spherically symmetric hypersurface deformations are, in fact, violated in the construction.
