 - **Abstract**
 In cosmological group field theory (GFT) models for quantum gravity coupled to a massless scalar field the total volume, seen as a function of the scalar field, follows the classical Friedmann dynamics of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe at low energies while resolving the Big Bang singularity at high energies. An open question is how to generalise these results to other homogeneous cosmologies. Here we take the first steps towards studying anisotropic Bianchi models in GFT, based on the introduction of a new anisotropy observable analogous to the $\beta$ variables in Misner's parametrisation. In a classical Bianchi I spacetime, $\beta$ behaves as a massless scalar field and can be used as a (gravitational) relational clock. We construct a GFT model for which in an expanding Universe $\beta$ initially behaves like its classical analogue before "decaying" showing a previously studied isotropisation. We support numerical results in GFT by analytical approximations in a toy model. One possible outcome of our work is a definition of relational dynamics in GFT that does not require matter.
