#### **Title:
          Discrete vs continuum gravitational diagrams in the soft synchronous gauge**
 - **Authors:** V.M. Khatsymovsky

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the non-renormalizability of continuum gravity, the perturbative expansion makes sense, say, for its discrete simplicial (Regge calculus) version. The finite-difference form of the gravity action has diffeomorphism symmetry at leading order over metric variations from site to site, and we add a term bilinear in $n^\lambda ( g_{\lambda \mu} - g_{\lambda \mu}^{(0 ) } )$, $n^\lambda = [ 1, - \varepsilon ( \Delta^{(s ) \alpha } \Delta^{(s ) }_\alpha )^{- 1} \Delta^{(s ) \beta } ]$, to "softly" fix the synchronous gauge $g_{0 \lambda} = g_{0 \lambda }^{(0 ) } = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$ at $\varepsilon \to 0$, thereby resolving singularities at $p_0 = 0$. For the symmetric form of the derivative $\Delta^{(s ) }_\lambda$, the propagator has a graviton pole at $p_0$ close to 0 or $\pm \pi$ at small $p_\alpha$. This pole doubling compared to the continuum case is removed by using the action $\check{S}_{\rm g}$ with the usual derivative $\Delta_\lambda = \exp ( i p_\lambda ) - 1$ instead of $\Delta^{(s ) }_\lambda = i \sin p_\lambda$ in some terms, including in the $k$ part of some term, and $\Delta^{(s ) }_\lambda$ in the $1 - k$ part of that term. Given the propagator $\check{G} ( n, \overline{n} )$, we form the principal value type propagator $\frac{1}{2} [ \check{G} ( n, n ) + \check{G} ( \overline{n}, \overline{n} ) ]$ by analytically continuing from real $n$. Singularities are roughly resolved as $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$. We find that it is $k = 1$ that provides this prescription to properly work and match the continuum case. The gauge-fixing term required for this propagator and its finiteness are considered; the ghost contribution is found to vanish at $\varepsilon \to 0$. The results are used for the diagram technique in our recent paper. The calculations are illustrated by the electromagnetic (Yang-Mills) case.

#### **Title:
          Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How?**
 - **Authors:** Martin Rainer
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order). Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.

#### **Title:
          Signatures of Quantum-Corrected Black Holes in Gravitational Waves from Periodic Orbits**
 - **Authors:** Fazlay Ahmed, Qiang Wu, Sushant G Ghosh, Tao Zhu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational wave emission from periodic timelike orbits of a test particle around a loop quantum gravity-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.
