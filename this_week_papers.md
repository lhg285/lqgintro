#### **Cancellation of quantum corrections on the soft curvature perturbations**
 - **Authors:** Yuichiro Tada, Takahiro Terada, Junsei Tokuda
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04732)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the cancellation of quantum corrections on the superhorizon curvature perturbations from subhorizon physics beyond the single-clock inflation from the viewpoint of the cosmological soft theorem. As an example, we focus on the transient ultra-slow-roll inflation scenario and compute the one-loop quantum corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations taking into account nontrivial surface terms in the action. We find that Maldacena's consistency relation is satisfied and guarantees the cancellation of contributions from the short-scale modes. As a corollary, primordial black hole production in single-field inflation scenarios is not excluded by perturbativity breakdown even for the sharp transition case in contrast to some recent claims in the literature. We also comment on the relation between the tadpole diagram in the in-in formalism and the shift of the elapsed time in the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. We find our argument is not directly generalisable to the tensor perturbations.

#### **Leading all-loop quantum contribution to the effective potential in the  inflationary cosmology**
 - **Authors:** D.I.Kazakov, R.M.Iakhibbaev, D.M.Tolkachev
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03872](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03872)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we have constructed quantum effective potentials and used them to study slow-roll inflationary cosmology. We derived the generalised RG equation for the effective potential in the leading logarithmic approximation and applied it to evaluate the potentials of the $T^2$ and $T^4$-models, which are often used in modern models of slow-roll inflation. We found that while the one-loop correction strongly affects the potential, breaking its original symmetry, the contribution of higher loops smoothes the behaviour of the potential. However, unlike the $\phi^4$-case, we found that the effective potentials preserve spontaneous symmetry breaking when summing all the leading corrections. We calculated the spectral indices $n_s$ and $r$ for the effective potentials of both models and found that they are consistent with the observational data for a wide range of parameters of the models.

#### **Preliminary analyses on dynamics and thermodynamics of rotating regular  black holes**
 - **Authors:** Hao Yang, Chang-Jiang Yu, Yan-Gang Miao
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03068)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical and thermodynamic laws governing rotating regular black holes. By analyzing dynamical properties, i.e., the interaction between scalar particles and rotating regular black holes, we establish the criteria that determine whether such black holes satisfy the laws of thermodynamics or not. In addition, we provide the general form of conserved quantities related to rotating regular black holes, including the relevant flows associated with neutral scalar particles. Meanwhile, we reexamine the relationship between the third law of thermodynamics and weak cosmic censorship conjecture for rotating regular black holes. In accordance with the criteria mentioned above, we discuss the laws of thermodynamics for three models of rotating regular black holes: Rotating Hayward black holes, Kerr black-bounce solutions, and loop quantum gravity black holes. Our findings indicate that none of the three models satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. In particular, the first and third models fail to comply with the three laws of thermodynamics, while the second model satisfies only the second and third laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we attempt to rescue the laws of thermodynamics by modifying entropy or extending phase space. However, the two scenarios are not able to ensure the three laws of thermodynamics in the three models, which reveals an unusual property of rotating regular black holes. 

#### **On perturbative aspects of a nonminimal Lorentz-violating QED with  CPT-even dimension-5 terms**
 - **Authors:** T. Mariz, M. Melo, J. R. Nascimento, A. Yu. Petrov
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02876)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explicitly calculate the lower CPT-even one-loop quantum corrections in nonminimal Lorentz-violating spinor QED with all possible CPT-even dimension-5 operators.
