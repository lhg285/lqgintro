#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity: Rovelli's lectures on LQG**
 - **Authors:** Pietropaolo Frisoni
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12215](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12215)
 - **Abstract**
 These notes are a transcript of Carlo Rovelli's lectures on Loop Quantum Gravity, given in Marseille in 2018, which (at present) can be entirely found on YouTube. I transcribed them in LaTeX in early 2020 as an exercise to get ready for my Ph.D. in LQG at Western University. This transcript is meant to be a (hopefully helpful) integration for the video version. I reported the order of the topics and the chronological structure exactly as presented by Rovelli throughout the course, primarily to facilitate the comparison. Each Section corresponds to a different Lecture. The parts written in textit are my additions. Sometimes in the text, I report references, which specify precisely the minute and the second of the corresponding video on YouTube, to very short historical digressions or excursus made during the lectures by Rovelli that I have not explicitly transcribed in these notes. Where appropriate, I took some figures from the book "Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity - An elementary introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory" by Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto, to which I always refer by the term "the book" in the following. For what concerns the equations, where possible, I tried to write down the "correct" versions present within the book. Finally, I thank Carlo Rovelli himself for reviewing these notes. I apologize in advance for any errors, and I wish everyone a lot of fun! 

#### **Constraints on rotating self-dual black hole with quasi-periodic  oscillations**
 - **Authors:** Cheng Liu, Haiguang Xu, Hoongwah Siew, Tao Zhu, Qiang Wu, Yuanyuan Zhao
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12323)
 - **Abstract**
 An impressive feature of loop quantum gravity (LQG) is that it can elegantly resolve both the big bang and black hole singularities. By using the Newman-Janis algorithm, a regular and effective rotating self-dual black hole(SDBH) metric could be constructed, which alters the Kerr geometry with a polymeric function $P$ from the quantum effects of LQG geometry. In this paper, we investigate its impact on the frequency characteristics of the X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations(QPOs) from 5 X-ray binaries and contrast it with the existing results of the orbital, periastron precession and nodal precession frequencies within the relativistic precession model. We apply a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation to examine the possible LQG effects on the X-ray QPOs. We found that the best constraint result for the rotating self-dual geometry from LQG came from the QPOs of X-ray binary GRO J1655-40, which establish an upper bound on the polymeric function $P$ less than $8.6\times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% confidence level. This bound leads to a restriction on the polymeric parameter $\delta$ of LQG to be 0.24.
