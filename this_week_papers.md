 - **Abstract**
 The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic photons and neutrinos, which suggests that the speed of light in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes an energy-dependent form, e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}}$, with $E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to consistently understand this picture, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **From loop quantum gravity to cosmology: the 2-vertex model**
 - **Authors:** Álvaro Cendal, Iñaki Garay, Luis J. Garay
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15320](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15320)
 - **Abstract**
 We show that the U(N)-symmetry reduction of the loop-quantum-gravity truncation known as the 2-vertex model provides the effective improved dynamics of loop quantum cosmology with an arbitrary perfect barotropic fluid content.
