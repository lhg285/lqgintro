 - **Abstract**
 The regularization of the scalar constraint and the Fermion coupling problem indicate that it is necessary to consider some kind of gauge fixing methods to deal with the simplicity constraint in all dimensional $SO(D+1)$ loop quantum gravity. The coherent state with well-behaved peakedness property is an essential ingredient to carry out the gauge fixing method. To provide the basic tool for constructing such kind of coherent state, we generalize the twisted geometry parametrization of the $SO(D+1)$ phase space of $(1+D)$-dimensional loop quantum gravity from the edge simplicity constraint surface to a dense subspace in the $SO(D+1)$ phase space. The symplectic structure on the twisted geometric parameter space and the Poisson structure in terms of the twisted geometric variables are analyzed. Besides, we discuss the relation between the twisted geometry parametrizations constructed on the edge simplicity constraint surface and the larger dense subspace of the $SO(D+1)$ phase space, and our result show that these two type of parametrizations are equivalent to each other by carrying out the gauge reduction with respect to the edge simplicity constraint.

#### **One-Loop Quantum Effects in Carroll Scalars**
 - **Authors:** Kinjal Banerjee, Rudranil Basu, Bhagya Krishnan, Sabyasachi Maulik, Aditya Mehra, Augniva Ray
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 Carrollian field theories at the classical level possess infinite number of space-time symmetries, namely the supertranslations. In this article we enquire whether these symmetries for interacting Carrollian scalar field theory survive in presence of quantum effects. For interactions polynomial in the field, the answer is in the affirmative. We also studied a renormalization group flow particularly tailored to respect the manifest Carroll invariance and analyzed the consequences of introducing Carroll-breaking deformations. The renormalization group flow, with perturbative loop level effects taken into account, indicates a new fixed point apart from the Gaussian ones.
