#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Bouncing Bianchi Models with Deformed Commutation Relations**
 - **Authors:** Gabriele Barca, Steffen Gielen
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.

#### **Title:
          Pseudo-Complex Gravity as a Geometric Resolution of the Black Hole Information Paradox**
 - **Authors:** Fridolin Weberand Peter O. Hess, Cesar A. Zen Vasconcellos
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the black hole information paradox in the setting of pseudo-complex gravity, a covariant geometric extension of general relativity that introduces a minimal length scale by deforming the spacetime manifold. In this framework, curvature invariants stay finite, and the classical singularity is geometrically regularized via a smooth core. We show that the correction term B/(6r**4) alters the Schwarzschild metric, generating the regularized geometry above, yielding a finite Hawking temperature, and inducing subleading corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Crucially, we demonstrate that the pseudo-complex geometric structure obstructs a clean factorization of the Hilbert space into interior and exterior regions, thereby removing the key assumption behind the standard derivation of the paradox. This structural reinterpretation of entanglement flow offers a new geometric route to unitarity preservation and information recovery. We examine the resulting effects on evaporation dynamics, entropy flow, and thermodynamic behavior. Our predictions are compared with those of generalized uncertainty principles (GUP), loop quantum gravity (LQG), and island-based models, and are summarized in a comparative table. Observable signatures-such as shifts in quasi-normal mode frequencies and the appearance of gravitational wave echoes from the regularized core-suggest that pseudo-complex gravity is a testable, covariant approach to resolving the paradox without invoking firewalls, holography, or exotic quantum states.
