 - **Abstract**
 While playing an important role in the foundations of quantum theory, Quantum Speed Limits (QSL) have no role in discussions about the search for quantum gravity. We fill this gap by analysing what QSL arises when superposing spherically symmetric masses in canonical quantum gravity. By this procedure, we find that the quantum mechanical Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds can be improved by superposing a spherically symmetric, static and asymptotically flat spacetime between states with different ADM energies and mass densities. We discuss the feasibility and significance of measuring times via these superpositions.
