#### **Title:
          Effective loop cosmology is a mere symplectic modification of standard cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Abraham Espinoza-Garc√≠a
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 It is shown that several prescriptions for the effective continuum limit of the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker loop quantum cosmology can be understood as the exact classical limit of the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of certain dynamical systems -- which are themeselves symplectic modifications of the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model. It is also demonstrated that a similar situation holds for two highly relevant anisotropic models. The required symplectic modifications are explicitly constructed. It is argued that this state of affairs makes the case for the associated Wheeler-DeWitt framework to be considered as an alternate quantum cosmology paradigm.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Kourosh Nozari, Sara Saghafi, Milad Hajebrahimi, Kimet Jusufi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.

#### **Title:
          Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Idrus Husin Belfaqih, Martin Bojowald, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Erick I. Duque
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 A recent covariant formulation, that includes non-perturbative effects from loop quantum gravity (LQG) as self-consistent effective models, has revealed the possibility of non-singular black hole solutions. The new framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation in the presence of quantum space-time effects while respecting general covariance. Standard methods to derive particle production both within the geometric optics approximation and the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling approach are therefore available and confirm the thermal nature of Hawking radiation. The covariant description of scale-dependent decreasing holonomy corrections maintains Hawking temperature as well as universality of the low-energy transmission coefficients, stating that the absorption rates are proportional to the horizon area at leading order. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. Nevertheless, they do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation: whether a black-to-white-hole transition, or a stable remnant, is preferred. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.
