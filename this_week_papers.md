#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum gravitational non-singular tunneling wavefunction proposal**
 - **Authors:** Meysam Motaharfar, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06760)
 - **Abstract**
 It was recently shown that tunneling wavefunction proposal is consistent with loop quantum geometry corrections including both holonomy and inverse scale factor corrections in the gravitational part of a spatially closed isotropic model with a positive cosmological constant. However, in presence of an inflationary potential the initial singularity is kinetic dominated and the effective minisuperspace potential again diverges at zero scale factor. Since the wavefunction in loop quantum cosmology cannot increase towards the zero scale factor, the tunneling wavefunction seems incompatible. We show that consistently including inverse scale factor modifications in scalar field Hamiltonian changes the effective potential into a barrier potential allowing the tunneling proposal. We also discuss a potential quantum instability of the cyclic universe resulting from tunneling. 

#### **Axial gravitational quasinormal modes of a self-dual black hole in loop  quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Sen Yang, Wen-Di Guo, Qin Tan, Yu-Xiao Liu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06895)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the axial gravitational quasinormal modes of a self-dual black hole in loop quantum gravity. Considering the axial perturbation of the background spacetime, we obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger-like master equation. Then we calculate the quasinormal frequencies with the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation and the asymptotic iteration method. We also investigate the numerical evolution of an initial wave packet on the self-dual black hole spacetime.~We find the quantum correction parameter $P$ positively affects the absolute values of both the real and imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies. We derive the relation between the parameters of the circular null geodesics and quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit for the self-dual black hole, and numerically verify this relation.
