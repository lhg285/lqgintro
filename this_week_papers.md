#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Emergent Gravity from the Entanglement Structure in Group Field Theory**
 - **Authors:** Jinglong Liu, Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano, Roman Pasechnik
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 We couple a scalar field encoding the entanglement between manifold sites to group field theory (GFT). The scalar field provides a relational clock that enables the derivation of the Hamiltonian of the system from the GFT action. Inspecting this Hamiltonian, we show that a theory of emergent gravity arises, and that the theory is equivalent to the Ashtekar variables' formulation of general relativity. The evolution of the system in GFT is a renormalization group (RG) flow, which corresponds to a simplified Ricci flow, the generator of which is the Hamiltonian, and the corresponding flow equation is regulated by the Shroedinger equation. As a consequence of the quantization procedure, the Hamiltonian is recovered to be non-Hermitian, and can be related to the complex action formalism, in which the initial conditions and the related future evolution of the systems are dictated by the imaginary part of the action.
