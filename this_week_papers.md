#### **Noncommutative effective LQC: A (pre-)inflationary dynamics  investigation**
 - **Authors:** Luis Rey Díaz-Barrón, Abraham Espinoza-García, S. Pérez-Payán, J. Socorro
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01363)
 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a (pre-)inflationary dynamics study within the framework of a simple noncommutative extension of effective loop quantum cosmology -- put forward recently by the authors -- which preserves its key features (in particular, the quantum bounce is maintained). A thorough investigation shows that the (pre-)inflationary scenario associated to the chaotic quadratic potential is in the overall the same as the one featured in standard loop quantum cosmology (which reinforces the conclusion reached by the authors in a preliminary analysis). Hence, this (pre-)inflationary scenario does not easily distinguish between standard loop quantum cosmology and the aforementioned noncommutative scheme. It is argued that a particular tuning of the noncommutativity parameter could accommodate for subtle effects at the level of primordial perturbations (the hybrid quantization framework being a tentative route of analysis).

#### **The Discreet Charm of the Discrete Series in DS$_2$**
 - **Authors:** Dionysios Anninos, Tarek Anous, Ben Pethybridge, Gizem Şengör
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15832](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15832)
 - **Abstract**
 We study quantum field theories placed on a two-dimensional de Sitter spacetime (dS$_2$) with an eye on the group-theoretic organisation of single and multi-particle states. We explore the distinguished role of the discrete series unitary irreducible representation (UIR) in the Hilbert space. By employing previous attempts to realise these states in free tachyonic scalar field theories, we propose how the discrete series may contribute to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann decomposition of an interacting scalar two-point function. We also study BF gauge theories with $SL(N,\mathbb{R})$ gauge group in dS$_2$ and establish a relation between the discrete series UIRs and the operator content of these theories. Although present at the level of the operators, states carrying discrete series quantum numbers are projected out of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space. This projection is reminiscent of what happens for quantum field theories coupled to semiclassical de Sitter gravity, where we must project onto the subspace of de Sitter invariant states. We discuss how to impose the diffeomorphism constraints on local field-theory operators coupled to two-dimensional gravity in de Sitter, with particular emphasis on the role of contact terms. Finally, we discuss an SYK-type model with a random two-body interaction that encodes an infinite tower of discrete series operators. We speculate on its potential microscopic connection to the $SL(N,\mathbb{R})$ BF theory in the large-$N$ limit.
