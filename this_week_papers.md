#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Transition Amplitudes in 3D Quantum Gravity: Boundaries and Holography  in the Coloured Boulatov Model**
 - **Authors:** Christophe Goeller, Daniele Oriti, Gabriel Schmid
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09159)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider transition amplitudes in the coloured simplicial Boulatov model for three-dimensional Riemannian quantum gravity. First, we discuss aspects of the topology of coloured graphs with non-empty boundaries. Using a modification of the standard rooting procedure of coloured tensor models, we then write transition amplitudes systematically as topological expansions. We analyse the transition amplitudes for the simplest boundary topology, the 2-sphere, and prove that they factorize into a sum entirely given by the combinatorics of the boundary spin network state and that the leading order is given by graphs representing the closed 3-ball in the large N limit. This is the first step towards a more detailed study of the holographic nature of coloured Boulatov-type GFT models for topological field theories and quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Leading all-loop quantum contribution to the effective potential in  general scalar field theory**
 - **Authors:** D. I. Kazakov, R.M. Iakhibbaev, D. M. Tolkachev
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08019)
 - **Abstract**
 The RG equation for the effective potential in the leading log (LL) approximation is constructed which is valid for an arbitrary scalar field theory in 4 dimensions. The solution to this equation sums up the leading log\phi contributions to all orders of perturbation theory. In general, this is the second order nonlinear partial differential equation, but in some cases it can be reduced to the ordinary one. For particular examples, this equation is solved numerically and the LL effective potential is constructed. The solution has a characteristic discontinuity replacing the Landau pole typical for the phi^4 theory. For a power-like potential no new minima appear due to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
