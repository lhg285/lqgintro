#### Spin foam related papers

#### **Entanglement in BF theory I: Essential topological entanglement**
 - **Authors:** Jackson R. Fliss, Stathis Vitouladitis
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06158](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06158)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the entanglement structure of Abelian topological order described by $p$-form BF theory in arbitrary dimensions. We do so directly in the low-energy topological quantum field theory by considering the algebra of topological surface operators. We define two appropriate notions of subregion operator algebras which are related by a form of electric-magnetic duality. To each subregion algebra we assign an entanglement entropy which we coin essential topological entanglement. This is a refinement to the traditional topological entanglement entropy. It is intrinsic to the theory, inherently finite, positive, and sensitive to more intricate topological features of the state and the entangling region. This paper is the first in a series of papers investigating entanglement and topological order in higher dimensions.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Extended phase space quantization of a black hole interior model in Loop  Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Beatriz Elizaga Navascués, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Andrés Mínguez Sánchez
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06090)
 - **Abstract**
 Considerable attention has been paid to the study of the quantum geometry of nonrotating black holes within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. This interest has been reinvigorated since the introduction of a novel effective model by Ashtekar, Olmedo and Singh. Despite recent advances in its foundation, there are certain questions about its quantization that still remain open. Here we complete this quantization taking as starting point an extended phase space formalism suggested by several authors, including the proposers of the model. Adopting a prescription that has proven succesful in Loop Quantum Cosmology, we construct an operator representation of the Hamiltonian constraint. By searching for solutions to this constraint operator in a sufficiently large set of dual states, we show that it can be solved for a continuous range of the black hole mass. This fact seems in favour of a conventional classical limit (at least for large masses) and contrasts with recent works that advocate a discrete spectrum. We present an algorithm that determines the solutions in closed form. To build the corresponding physical Hilbert space and conclude the quantization, we carry out an asymptotic analysis of those solutions, which allows us to introduce a suitable inner product on them.

#### **Lorentzian quantum cosmology from effective spin foams**
 - **Authors:** Bianca Dittrich, José Padua-Argüelles
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06012](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06012)
 - **Abstract**
 Effective spin foams provide the computationally most efficient spin foam models yet and are therefore ideally suited for applications e.g. to quantum cosmology. We provide here the first effective spin foam computations of a finite time evolution step in a Lorentzian quantum de Sitter universe. We will consider a set-up which computes the no-boundary wave function, as well as a set-up describing the transition between two finite scale factors. A key property of spin foams is that they implement discrete spectra for the areas. We therefore study the effects that are induced by the discrete spectra. To perform these computations we had to identify a technique to deal with highly oscillating and slowly converging, or even diverging sums. We illustrate here that high order Shanks transformation work very well and are a promising tool for the evaluation of Lorentzian (gravitational) path integrals and spin foam sums.
