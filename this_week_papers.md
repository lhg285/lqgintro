#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Gravitational Particle Production and the Validity of Effective  Descriptions in Loop Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Gustavo S. Vicente, Rudnei O. Ramos, Leila L. Graef
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00435)
 - **Abstract**
 The effective approach in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) has provided means to obtain predictions for observable quantities in LQC models. While an effective dynamics in LQC has been extensively considered in different scenarios, a robust demonstration of the validity of effective descriptions for the perturbative level still requires further attention. The consistency of the description adopted in most approaches requires the assumption of a test field approximation, which is limited to the cases in which the backreaction of the particles gravitationally produced can be safely neglected. Within the framework of LQC, some of the main approaches to quantize the linear perturbations are the dressed metric, the hybrid approaches and the closed/deformed algebra approach. Here, we analyze the consistency of the test field assumption in these frameworks by computing the energy density stored in the particles gravitationally produced compared to the background energy density. This analysis ultimately provides us with a consistency test of the effective descriptions of LQC. 

#### **Poisson brackets in Sobolev spaces: a mock holonomy-flux algebra**
 - **Authors:** J Fernando Barbero G, Marc Basquens, Bogar Díaz, Eduardo J S Villaseñor
 - **Subjects:** Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00342)
 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this paper is to discuss a number of issues that crop up in the computation of Poisson brackets in field theories. This is specially important for the canonical approaches to quantization and, in particular, for loop quantum gravity. We illustrate the main points by working out several examples. Due attention is paid to relevant analytic issues that are unavoidable in order to properly understand how computations should be carried out. Although the functional spaces that we use throughout the paper will likely have to be modified in order to deal with specific physical theories such as general relativity, many of the points that we will raise will also be relevant in that context. The specific example of the mock holonomy-flux algebra will be considered in some detail and used to draw some conclusions regarding the loop quantum gravity formalism.
