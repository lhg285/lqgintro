 - **Abstract**
 The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most significant challenges, primarily due to the ``frozen'' formalism emerging from the Wheeler--DeWitt equation. Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel approach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing a divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum gravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the Hubbard--Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in spacetime foliations, enabling a Schr√∂dinger-like evolution that preserves diffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary evolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the foliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive process emerging from quantum fluctuations -- where correlations between matter and geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This is considerably a potential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining background independence in canonical quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Abstract**
 The conference \emph{Black Holes Inside and Out} marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on conceptual issues, especially on the key features that distinguish the LQG approach, and on concrete results that underlie the paradigm that has emerged. This is \emph{not} meant to be an exhaustive review. Rather, it is a broad-brush stroke portrait of the present status. Further details can be found in the references listed.
