#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Quantizing the Bosonic String on a Loop Quantum Gravity Background**
 - **Authors:** Deepak Vaid, Luigi Teixeira de Sousa
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 With the goal of understanding whether or not it is possible to construct a string theory which is consistent with loop quantum gravity (LQG), we study alternate versions of the Nambu-Goto action for a bosonic string. We consider two types of modifications. The first is a phenomenological action based on the observation that LQG tells us that areas of two-surfaces are operators in quantum geometry and are bounded from below. This leads us to a string action which is similar to that of bimetric gravity. We provide formulations of the bimetric string for both the Nambu-Goto (second order) and Polyakov (first order) formulations. We explore the classical solutions of this action and its quantization and relate it to the conventional string solutions. The second is an action in which the background geometry is described in terms of the pullback of the connection which describes the bulk geometry to the worldsheet. The resulting action is in the form of a gauged sigma model, where the spacetime co-ordinates are now vectors which transform under $ISO(D,1)$. We find that for the particular case of a constant background connection the action reduces to the bimetric action discussed above. We discuss classical solutions and quantization strategies for this action and its implications for the broader program of unifying string theory and loop quantum gravity.
