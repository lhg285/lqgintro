 - **Abstract**
 We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of quantum gravity in de Sitter space.
