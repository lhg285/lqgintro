#### **A spin foam framework for the black-to-white hole transition**
 - **Authors:** Farshid Soltani
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07589)
 - **Abstract**
 Black holes formation and evolution have been extensively studied at the classical level. However, not much is known regarding the end of their lives, a phase that requires to consider the quantum nature of the gravitational field. A black-to-white hole transition can capture the physics of this phenomenon, in particular the physics of the residual small black holes at the end of the Hawking evaporation. This work shows how the spin foam formalism is able to describe this non-perturbative phenomenon. A thorough examination of the black hole spacetime region in which quantum effects cannot be neglected indicates that the scenario in which the black hole geometry undergoes a quantum transition in a white hole geometry is natural and conservative. This quantum transition is then studied using the spin foam formalism and the resulting transition amplitude is explicitly computed.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Effective black hole interior and the Raychadhuri equation**
 - **Authors:** Keagan Blanchette, Saurya Das, Samantha Hergott, Saeed Rastgoo
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05397)
 - **Abstract**
 We show that loop quantum gravity effects leads to the finiteness of expansion and its rate of change in the effective regime in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. As a consequence the singularity is resolved.
