 - **Abstract**
 In both mathematics and physics, topological field theories and holomorphic field theories appear naturally, but there are interesting theories that are hybrids -- looking topological in some directions and holomorphic in others -- such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern--Simons theory. In this paper we construct perturbative, one-loop quantizations rigorously on the model manifold $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{C}^n$, and find a remarkable vanishing result about anomalies: the one-loop obstruction to quantization on $\mathbb{R}^m\times \mathbb{C}^n$ vanishes when $m\geq 1$. A concrete consequence of our results is the existence of exact and finite quantizations at one-loop for twists of pure $\mathcal{N} =2$ four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory.

#### **Non-singular quantum gravitational dynamics of an LTB dust shell model:  the role of quantization prescriptions**
 - **Authors:** Kristina Giesel, Bao-Fei Li, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05797](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05797)
 - **Abstract**
 We study some consequences of the loop quantization of the outermost dust shell in the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime with a homogeneous dust density using different quantization strategies motivated by loop quantum gravity. Prior work has dealt with loop quantizing this model by employing holonomies and the triads, following the procedure in standard loop quantum cosmology. In this work we compare this quantization with the one in which holonomies and gauge-covariant fluxes are used. While both of the quantization schemes resolve the central singularity, they lead to different mass gaps at which a trapped surface forms. This trapped surface which is matched to an exterior generalized Vaidya spacetime disappears when the density of the dust shell is in the Planck regime. We find that the quantization based on holonomies and gauge-covariant fluxes generically results in an asymmetric evolution of the dust shell in which the effective mass associated with the white hole as seen by an external observer is $2/\pi$ of the one for the black hole. This effective difference in masses results from difference in the classical limits in pre- and post-bounce regimes in the two quantizations. This distinctive feature rules out formation of any black hole-white hole twin in presence of gauge-covariant flux modifications which is in contrast to the quantization using holonomies and triads where the gravitational collapse always leads to a black hole-white hole twins. In another striking difference, for the quantization based on holonomies and gauge-covariant fluxes there can be situations in which during a non-singular collapse only a black hole forms without a white hole.

#### **Electromagnetic duality and central charge from first order formulation**
 - **Authors:** Marc Geiller, Puttarak Jai-akson, Abdulmajid Osumanu, Daniele Pranzetti
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the infrared triangle there have been recent discussions on the existence and the role of dual charges. We present a new viewpoint on dual magnetic charges in $p$-form theories, and argue that they can be inherited from the charges of a first order formulation as a topological BF theory with potential. This happens because, depending on the spacetime dimension and on the form degree, the so-called translational gauge symmetries of BF theory become reducible and therefore admit zero-modes. Although such zero-modes lead to trivial symmetries of the $p$-form theory, they are associated with non-trivial charges. These turn out to be precisely the dual magnetic charges. The centrally-extended current algebra of electric and magnetic charges in the $p$-form theory then descends naturally from that of BF theory. This is an effort towards finding an existence criterion for dual charges.
