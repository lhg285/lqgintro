#### **Gravitational lens effect of a holonomy corrected Schwarzschild black  hole**
 - **Authors:** Ednaldo L. B. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues, Henrique A. Vieira
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02658)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild solution with holonomy corrections. We use two types of approximation methods to calculate the deflection angle, namely the weak and strong field limits. For the first method, we calculate the deflection angle up to the fifth order of approximation and show the influence of the parameter $\lambda$ (in terms of loop quantum gravity) on it. In addition, we construct expressions for the magnification, the position of the lensed images and the time delay as functions of the coefficients from the deflection angle expansion. We find that $\lambda$ increases the deflection angle. In the strong field limit, we use a logarithmic approximation to compute the deflection angle. We then write four observables, in terms of the coefficients $b_1$, $b_2$ and $u_m$, namely: the asymptotic position approached by a set of images $\theta_{\infty}$, the distance between the first image and the others $s$, the ratio between the flux of the first image and the flux of all other images $r_m$, and the time delay between two photons $\Delta T_{2,1}$. We then use the experimental data of the black hole Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ and calculate the observables and the coefficients of the logarithmic expansion. We find that the parameter $\lambda$ increases the deflection angle, the separation between the lensed images and the delay time between them. In contrast, it decreases the brightness of the first image compared to the others.

#### **Quasinormal modes of loop quantum black holes near the Planck scale**
 - **Authors:** Douglas M. Gingrich
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00722)
 - **Abstract**
 We compare four loop quantum gravity inspired black hole metrics near the Planck scale. Spin 0, 1/2, 1, and 2 field perturbations on these backgrounds are studied. The axial gravitational quasinormal modes are calculated and compared. The time evolution of the ringdown is examined. We also calculate the quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and compare with the predictions from circular null geodesics. 

#### **Quantum geometric formulation of Brans-Dicke theory for Bianchi I  spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Manabendra Sharma, Gustavo S. Vicente, Leila L. Graef, Rudnei O. Ramos, Anzhong Wang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01080](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01080)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider a formulation of the Brans-Dicke theory in Jordan's frame for Bianchi-I spacetime within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified. We also present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics. In particular, starting with a detailed constraint analysis, we present the off-shell Lie algebra of the full theory in the geometrodynamic phase space. This is followed by casting the theory in terms of the Yang-Mills phase space variables suitable for invoking loop quantization and show that the system is highly nonlinear. Finally, we present the quantum-corrected effective dynamics that resolve the initial singularity

#### **$\mathbb{Z}_N$ Duality and Parafermions Revisited**
 - **Authors:** Zhihao Duan, Qiang Jia, Sungjay Lee
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01913)
 - **Abstract**
 Given a two-dimensional bosonic theory with a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the orbifolding and fermionization can be understood holographically using three-dimensional BF theory with level $2$. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the information of dualities is encoded in a topological boundary state which is defined as an eigenstate of certain Wilson loop operators (anyons) in the bulk. We generalize this story to two-dimensional theories with non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, focusing on parafermionization. We find the generic operators defining different topological boundary states including orbifolding and parafermionization with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ or subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and discuss their algebraic properties as well as the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ duality web.
