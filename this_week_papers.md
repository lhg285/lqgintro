 - **Abstract**
 The first images of black hole shadows open new possibilities to develop modern extended gravity theories. We discuss the shadow calculations in non-rotating case both when $g_{11} = - g_{00}^{-1}$ and $g_{11} \neq - g_{00}^{-1}$. We demonstrate the application to few different models: Horndesky theory with Gauss-Bonnet invariant, loop quantum gravity and conformal gravity. The difference of these theories from shadow models with the theory of general relativity is shown. In addition we show that when the rotation is taken into account the requirements to the observational accuracy decrease.
