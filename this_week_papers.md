#### **Title:
          Perturbative Quantization of Modified Maxwell Electrodynamics**
 - **Authors:** Cian Luke Martin

 - **Abstract**
 Modified Maxwell electrodynamics, or ModMax for short, is the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves its notable symmetries: conformal invariance and electromagnetic duality. ModMax has been studied extensively at the classical level, however remains largely untouched in a quantum context due to its non-analytic nature. In this thesis, we perform the perturbative quantization of this theory. Using the background field method and dimensional regularization, we obtain novel corrections by calculating the one loop quantum effective action. These corrections vanish in a background with constant field strength, and are not of the form of the classical theory for a general background field. Motivated by the corrections obtained for ModMax, we applied the method developed to quantize ModMax to its two dimensional analogue theory. We similarly obtain the one loop quantum effective action for this theory in a general background by evaluating all one loop Feynman diagrams. In addition, we study the divergence of the separate infinite series of two vertex diagrams.

#### **Title:
          Spikes and spines in 3D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Johanna Borissova, Bianca Dittrich, Dongxue Qu, Marc Schiffer

 - **Abstract**
 Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as Quantum Regge Calculus and Spin Foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while keeping the lengths of the boundary edges small. Such configurations pose significant challenges in Euclidean Quantum Regge Calculus, as they lead to infinities for the partition function and length expectation values. Here we investigate such configurations in three-dimensional Lorentzian Quantum Regge Calculus, and find that the partition function and length expectation values remain finite. This shows that the Lorentzian approach can avoid a key issue of the Euclidean approach. We also find that the space of configurations, for which bulk edges can become very large, is much richer than in the Euclidean case. In particular, it includes configurations with irregular light-cone structures, which lead to imaginary terms in the Regge action and branch cuts along the Lorentzian path integral contour. Hence, to meaningfully define the Lorentzian Regge path integral, one needs to clarify how such configurations should be handled.
