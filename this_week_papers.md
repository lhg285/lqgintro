 - **Abstract**
 It is generally expected that in a non-singular cosmological model a cyclic evolution is straightforward to obtain on introduction of a suitable choice of a scalar field with a negative potential or a negative cosmological constant which causes a recollapse at some time in the evolution. We present a counter example to this conventional wisdom. Working in the realm of loop cosmological models with non-perturbative quantum gravity modifications we show that a modified version of standard loop quantum cosmology based on Thiemann's regularization of the Hamiltonian constraint while generically non-singular does not allow a cyclic evolution unless some highly restrictive conditions hold. Irrespective of the energy density of other matter fields, a recollapse and hence a cyclic evolution is only possible if one chooses an almost Planck sized negative potential of the scalar field or a negative cosmological constant. Further, cycles when present do not occur in the classical regime. Surprisingly, a necessary condition for a cyclic evolution, not singularity resolution, turns out to be a violation of the weak energy condition. These results are in a striking contrast to standard loop quantum cosmology where obtaining a recollapse at large volumes and a cyclic evolution is straightforward, and, there is no violation of weak energy condition. On one hand our work shows that some quantum cosmological models even though non-singular and bouncing are incompatible with a cyclic evolution, and on the other hand demonstrates that differences in various quantization prescriptions in loop cosmology need not be faint and buried in the pre-bounce regime, but can be striking and profound even in the post-bounce regime. 

#### **Nonclassical cosmological dynamics in the low-energy limit of loop  quantum scalar-tensor theory**
 - **Authors:** Yu Han

 - **Abstract**
 In previous work, we showed that in loop quantum cosmology of scalar-tensor theory (STT) with the holonomy correction the background equations of motion in the Jordan frame have two branches, i.e., the $b_{+}$ branch and the $b_{-}$ branch. In the low-energy limit, the $b_{+}$ branch of the equations of motion reproduce the equations of motion of classical STT while the $b_{-}$ branch of equations of motion do not reproduce the classical equations. In this paper, we investigate cosmological dynamics in an expanding Universe whose background is described by the the $b_{-}$ branch of equations of motion; and we especially focus on the dynamics of the perturbations in the low-energy limit because it is most relevant to the current observational range.First, we show that the low-energy limit of $b_{-}$ branch of equations of motion can be a stable attractor in the expansion phase of the Universe. Then, we find a low-energy effective Hamiltonian on the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. The background part of this Hamiltonian can yield the low-energy limit of the $b_{-}$ branch of equations and this Hamiltonian consists of constraints whose constraint algebra is different from the classical case but also closed up to arbitrary order of perturbations. Remarkably, we find that this Hamiltonian can be transformed into the Hamiltonian of the Einstein frame by field redefinitions. Moreover, we also develop the linear cosmological perturbation theory and apply it to study the slow-roll inflation in this context. Finally, we study a specific model of STT in which the background of the expanding Universe is described by the $b_{-}$ branch of equations of motion. It is shown that the slow-roll inflation can take place in this case and the spectral indices agree well with the observations.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Glimmers of a post-geometric perspective**
 - **Authors:** Federico Piazza
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum gravitational effects could become important at low energy if the wavefunction of the metric field fails to be peaked around a classical configuration. We try to understand such deviations from classicality within canonical quantum gravity by introducing a "fluid of observers" in the low energy theory and defining a distance operator "at equal time" among them. We find that, even in the presence of relevant fluctuations in the metric field, a "locally flat" limit is recovered in the neighbourhood of each observer. Deviations from classicality have no local consequences. However, at larger separations the expectation value of the distance operator behaves differently than a standard Riemannian distance. In particular, it is non-additive and thus cannot be obtained by the integral of a differential line element. This emerging beyond Riemannian geometry is a metric space similar to embedded Riemannian manifolds equipped with chord distances that "cut through" the ambient space. We study deviations from flat space by looking at triangles in the limit where their sizes go to zero. Beyond-Riemannian deviations with respect to flat space are of the same order as standard Riemannian ones, but qualitatively different. Some implications on the bulk picture of holographic theories and black hole evaporation are discussed.
