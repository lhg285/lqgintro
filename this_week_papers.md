#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Towards black hole entropy in chiral loop quantum supergravity**
 - **Authors:** Konstantin Eder, Hanno Sahlmann
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01661](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01661)
 - **Abstract**
 Recently, many geometric aspects of $\mathcal{N}$-extended AdS supergravity in chiral variables have been encountered and clarified. In particular, if the theory is supposed to be invariant under SUSY transformations also on boundaries, the boundary term has to be the action of a $\mathrm{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ super Chern-Simons theory, and particular boundary conditions must be met. Based on this, we propose a way to calculate an entropy $S$ for surfaces, presumably including black hole horizons, in the supersymmetric version of loop quantum gravity for the minimal case $\mathcal{N}=1$. It proceeds in analogy to the non-supersymmetric theory, by calculating dimensions of quantum state spaces of the super Chern-Simons theory with punctures, for fixed quantum (super) area of the surface. We find $S = a_H/4$ for large areas and determine the subleading correction. Due to the non-compactness of $\mathrm{OSp}(1|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ and the corresponding difficulties with the Chern-Simons quantum theory, we use analytic continuation from the Verlinde formula for a compact real form, $\mathrm{UOSp}(1|2)$, in analogy to work by Noui et al. This also entails studying some properties of $\mathrm{OSp}(1|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ representations that we have not found elsewhere in the literature.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Classical dynamics for Loop Gravity: The 2-vertex model**
 - **Authors:** Eneko Aranguren, Iñaki Garay, Etera R. Livine
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00307](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00307)
 - **Abstract**
 The study of toy models in loop quantum gravity (LQG), defined as truncations of the full theory, is relevant to both the development of the LQG phenomenology, in cosmology and astrophysics, and the progress towards the resolution of the open issues of the theory, in particular the implementation of the dynamics. Here, we study the dynamics of spin network states of quantum geometry defined on the family of graphs consisting in 2 vertices linked by an arbitrary number of edges, or 2-vertex model in short. A symmetry reduced sector of this model -- to isotropic and homogeneous geometries -- was successfully studied in the past, where interesting cosmological insights were found. We now study the evolution of the classical trajectories for this system in the general case, for arbitrary number of edges with random initial configurations. We use the spinorial formalism and its clear interpretation of spin networks in terms of discrete twisted geometries, with the quantum 3d space made of superpositions of polyhedra glued together by faces of equal area. Remarkably, oscillatory and divergent regimes are found with a universal dependence on the coupling constants of the Hamiltonian and independent of the initial spinors or the number of edges. Furthermore, we explore the evolution of the associated polyhedra as well as their volumes and areas. 

#### **Cauchy Slice Holography: A New AdS/CFT Dictionary**
 - **Authors:** Goncalo Araujo-Regado, Rifath Khan, Aron C. Wall
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00591)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a new approach to holography in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, in which time rather than space is the emergent dimension. By making a sufficiently large T^2-deformation of a Euclidean CFT, we define a holographic theory that lives on Cauchy slices of the Lorentzian bulk. (More generally, for an arbitrary Hamiltonian constraint equation that closes, we show how to obtain it by an irrelevant deformation from a CFT with suitable anomalies.) The partition function of this theory defines a natural map between the bulk canonical quantum gravity theory Hilbert space, and the Hilbert space of the usual (undeformed) boundary CFT. We argue for the equivalence of the ADM and CFT Hamiltonians. We also explain how bulk unitarity emerges naturally, even though the boundary theory is not reflection-positive. This allows us to reformulate the holographic principle in the language of Wheeler-DeWitt canonical quantum gravity. Along the way, we outline a procedure for obtaining a bulk Hilbert space from the gravitational path integral with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Following previous conjectures, we postulate that this finite-cutoff gravitational path integral agrees with the T^2-deformed theory living on an arbitrary boundary manifold -- at least near the semiclassical regime. However, the T^2-deformed theory may be easier to UV complete, in which case it would be natural to take it as the definition of nonperturbative quantum gravity.
