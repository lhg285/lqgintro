#### **Title:
          Casimir Wormholes with GUP Correction in the Loop Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Celio R. Muniz, Takol Tangphati, R. M. P. Neves, M. B. Cruz
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we obtain novel traversable, static, and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions, derived from the effective energy density and isotropic pressure resulting from the Casimir effect, corrected by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). The goal is to explore the interplay between competing quantum gravity effects and quantum vacuum phenomena in the emergence of non-trivial spacetime structures. We examine features such as traversability, embedding diagrams, energy conditions, curvature, and stability of the obtained solutions. Additionally, we analyze the junction conditions required to integrate the wormhole spacetime with an external Schwarzschild spacetime and calculate the amount of exotic matter needed to maintain the wormhole. Finally, we evaluate the conditions under which this latter remains visible or is hidden by the event horizon associated with the Schwarzschild spacetime.

#### **Title:
          Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Jamal Saeed, Rui Pan, Christian Brown, Gerald Clevear, Anzhong Wang

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.
