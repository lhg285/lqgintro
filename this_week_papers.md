 - **Abstract**
 We construct an explicit model for the black hole to white hole transition (known as the black hole fireworks scenario) using the cut-and-paste technique. We model a black hole collapse using the evolution of a time-like shell in the background of the loop quantum gravity inspired metric. We then use the space-like shell analysis to construct the firework geometry. Our simple and well defined analysis removes some subtle issues that were present in the previous literature. In particular, we demonstrate that the null energy condition must be violated for the bounce. We also calculate the proper time scales required for the black to white hole transition, which in any valid scenario must be shorter than the evaporation time scale. In contrast, we show that the bouncing time for the distant observer can be chosen arbitrarily, since it is determined by how one cuts and pastes the spacetimes outside the event horizon, and thus does not have any obvious connection to quantum gravity effects.

#### **Generalised Gaussian states in group field theory**
 - **Authors:** Andrea Calcinari, Steffen Gielen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08667)
 - **Abstract**
 We define generalised Gaussian states in group field theory built on a single field mode, and study their semiclassical properties relevant for the application to cosmology. These states are generalisations of coherent, squeezed and thermal states considered previously. As two possible characterisations of semiclassicality, we contrast the requirement of small relative fluctuations in volume and energy with the saturation of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. We find that for the most general class of states the appearance of small relative fluctuations, which we take as the main criterion relevant for the emergence of cosmology, is mostly determined by the amount of displacement used to define the state. We also observe that defining such generalised Gaussian states is less straightforward in the algebraic approach to canonical quantisation of GFT, and discuss special cases.
