#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Numerical analysis of the self-energy in covariant LQG**
 - **Authors:** Pietropaolo Frisoni, Francesco Gozzini, Francesca Vidotto
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14781](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14781)
 - **Abstract**
 We study numerically the first order radiative corrections to the self-energy, in covariant loop quantum gravity. We employ the recently developed 'sl2cfoam-next' spinfoam amplitudes library, and some original numerical methods. We analyze the scaling of the divergence with the infrared cutoff, for which previous analytical estimates provided widely different lower and upper bounds. Our findings suggest that the divergence is approximately linear in the cutoff. We also investigate the role of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter in the asymptotic behavior, the dependence of the scaling on some boundary data and the expectation values of boundary operators. 

#### **Non-extensive Statistical Mechanics and the Thermodynamic Stability of  FRW Universe**
 - **Authors:** Yang Liu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15077](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15077)
 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we investigate the thermodynamic stability of the FRW universe for two examples, Tsallis entropy and loop quantum gravity, by considering non-extensive statistical mechanics. The heat capacity, free energy and pressure of the universe are obtained. For the Tsallis entropy model, we obtained the constraint for $\beta$, namely, $1/2 < \beta < 2$. The free energy of a thermal equilibrium universe must be less than zero. We suggest that the reason for the accelerated expansion of the universe is not due to Tsallis entropy. Similar results are obtained for loop quantum gravity. However, since the values of $\Lambda(\gamma)$ and $q$ cannot be determined in this model, the results become more subtle than that in the Tsallis entropy model. In addition, we compare the results for the universe with those for a Schwarzschild black hole.
