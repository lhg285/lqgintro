 - **Abstract**
 Loop quantization of Schwarzschild black holes with a cosmological constant for polymerization parameters which are constant is studied in the effective spacetime description. We show that for the positive cosmological constant there can be an appearance of large quantum effects at small spacetime curvatures. These effects can manifest as an additional black hole horizon. While the central singularity is resolved in all the cases, these limitations demonstrate incompatibility of the Kantowski-Sachs gauge and schemes with fixed polymerization parameters in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. In contrast, the case of a negative cosmological constant is free of such problematic features. Noted limitations are similar to those in the $\mu_o$ scheme for the loop quantization of cosmological models.

          The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation**
 - **Authors:** Noah M. MacKay

 - **Abstract**
 Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: \textit{Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics?} This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints from information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and obeying any statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this, we obtain the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ and the system energy of the black hole as its thermal energy: $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.
