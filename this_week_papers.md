#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Consequences of regularization ambiguities in Loop Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Maciej Kowalczyk
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07786)
 - **Abstract**
 Ambiguities of the so-called Thiemann regularization in Loop Quantum Cosmology lead to freedom in how to construct a particular quantization prescription. So far three distinct examples of such have been proposed in the literature. For two of them, detailed analysis has been already performed in the literature. In this thesis, the methodology developed for these is applied to study in detail the third one, which will be referred to as mLQC-II. In particular, the mathematical properties of the operator of the quantum version of full Hamiltonian constraint are examined. These properties indicate that the evolution of the system is uniquely determined. Furthermore, an investigation of dynamics is performed by finding the expectation value of the volume as a function of the scalar field and constants of motion. This result is next compared to the trajectories predicted with the so-called effective dynamics. Finally, the main properties of studied prescription are compared against those of other (already investigated) ones. 

#### **Black Holes, Gravitational Waves and Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** W. F. Chagas-Filho
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08019)
 - **Abstract**
 Loop Quantum Gravity is a theory that attempts to describe the quantum mechanics of the gravitational field based on the canonical quantization of General Relativity. According to Loop Quantum Gravity, in a gravitational field, geometric quantities such as area and volume are quantized in terms of the Planck lenth. In this paper we present the basic ideas for a future, mathematically more rigorous, attempt to combine black holes and gravitational waves using the quantization of geometric quantities introduced by Loop Quantum Gravity.

#### **Lattice BF Theory, Dumbbells, and Composite Fermions**
 - **Authors:** Tom Banks, Bingnan Zhang
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08316](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08316)
 - **Abstract**
 We formulate $U(1)$ $bda$ Chern-Simons theory, which is also called BF theory, on a lattice, adapting a method proposed by Kantor and Susskind for the groups $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N$. Our method applies to any finite or infinite abelian group. We study the discrete symmetries and use the model to provide a rigorous treatment of the composite fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), with no ambiguities relating to intersecting Wilson/'t Hooft lines. We derive Jain's fractions, and one can also calculate corrections to the mean field solution within this framework. We also generalize the formalism to higher form gauge models in arbitrary dimension, and suggest a possible non-Abelian extension.
