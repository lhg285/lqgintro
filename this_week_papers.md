 - **Abstract**
 A recent development involves an intriguing model of a quantum-corrected black hole, established through the application of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model within loop quantum cosmology [Lewandowski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023) 10, 101501]. Employing both time-domain integration and the WKB approach, we compute the quasinormal frequencies for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino perturbations in these quantum-corrected black holes. Our analysis reveals that while the real oscillation frequencies undergo only minor adjustments due to the quantum parameter, the damping rate experiences a significant decrease as a result of its influence. We also deduce the analytic formula for quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and show that the correspondence between the null geodesics and eikoanl quasinormal modes holds in this case.
