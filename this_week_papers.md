#### **Title:
          Emergent Gravity from Topological Quantum Field Theory: Stochastic Gradient Flow Perspective away from the Quantum Gravity Problem**

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a scenario according to which the ultraviolet completion of General Relativity is realized through a stochastic gradient flow towards a topological BF theory. Specifically, we consider the stochastic gradient flow of a pre-geometric theory proposed by Wilczek. Its infrared limit exists, and corresponds to a fixed point where stochastic fluctuations vanish. Diffeomorphism symmetries are restored in this limit, where the theory is classical and expressed by the Einstein-Hilbert action. The infrared phase then corresponds to the classical theory of General Relativity, the quantization of which becomes meaningless. Away from the infrared limit, in the pre-geometric phase of the stochastic gradient flow, the relevant fields of the Wilczek theory undergo stochastic fluctuations. The theory can be quantized perturbatively, generating corrections to the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. The stochastic gradient flow also possesses an ultraviolet fixed point. The theory flows to a topological BF action, to which general non-perturbative quantization methods can be applied. Two phase transitions occur along the thermal time dynamics, being marked by: i) the breakdown of the topological BF symmetries in the ultraviolet regime, which originates the pre-geometric phase described by the Wilczek theory; ii) the breakdown of the parental symmetries characterizing the Wilczek theory, from which General Relativity emerges. The problem of quantizing the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity finally becomes redundant.

#### **Title:
          Love Numbers of Covariant Loop Quantum Black Holes**
 - **Authors:** Meysam Motaharfar, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the linear static response of three covariant loop quantum black holes, namely, the two models proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma, and Yang (ZLMY) and the Alonso-Bardaji, Brizuela, and Vera (ABV) model, to an external tidal field. Using effective spacetime description, we uniquely extract the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) using perturbative solutions derived from the Green's function technique. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to the classical Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs for loop quantum black holes are generally nonzero. The sign and magnitude of the TLNs depend on the spin of the external tidal field, the multipole number, and the details of the loop quantized model. The magnitude of the TLNs is found to be Planck scale suppressed for all three models, implying a stronger tidal deformability for black holes with Planckian mass. Additionally, for the same black hole mass, the magnitude of the TLNs for the ABV model is larger than the ZLMY models. We also find that the TLNs exhibit logarithmic running behavior at the leading order, even for low multipole numbers, in response to scalar and vector field perturbations. These distinct features of the TLNs can serve as a potential tool to differentiate between various quantization ambiguities arising in loop quantum black holes. We briefly discuss the potential phenomenological and theoretical implications of nonzero TLNs for black hole physics.
