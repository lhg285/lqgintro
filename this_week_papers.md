#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Geodesics in Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Benjamin Koch, Ali Riahinia, Angel Rincon
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale. This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Constraints on quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes with eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals**
 - **Authors:** Sen Yang, Yu-Peng Zhang, Li Zhao, Yu-Xiao Liu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections $(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.
