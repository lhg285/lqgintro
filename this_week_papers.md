 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence of singularities where spacetime curvature becomes infinite and geodesic evolution breaks down are inevitable events in classical general relativity (GR) unless one chooses an exotic matter violating weak energy condition. These singularities show up in various physical processes, such as the gravitational collapse, the birth of the universe in the standard cosmology as well as the classical solutions of the black hole spacetimes. In the last two decades, a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of quantum spacetime and the way it resolves singularities has been achieved in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) which applies the concepts and techniques of loop quantum gravity to the symmetry reduced cosmological spacetimes. Due to the fundamental discreteness of quantum geometry derived from the quantum theory, the big bang singularity has been robustly shown to be replaced by a big bounce. Strong curvature singularities intrinsic in the classical cosmology are generically resolved for a variety of cosmological spacetimes including anisotropic models and polarized Gowdy models. Using effective spacetime description the LQC universe also provides an ultra-violet complete description of the classical inflationary scenario as well as its alternatives such as the ekpyrotic and matter bounce scenarios. In this chapter we provide a summary of singularity resolution and its physical implications for various isotropic and anisotropic cosmological spacetimes in LQC and analyze robustness of results through variant models originating from different quantization prescriptions.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks**
 - **Authors:** Grzegorz Czelusta, Jakub Mielczarek
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 Spin network states are a powerful tool for constructing the $SU(2)$ gauge theories on a graph. In loop quantum gravity (LQG), they have yielded many promising predictions, although progress has been limited by the computational challenge of dealing with high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. To explore more general configurations, quantum computing methods can be applied by representing spin network states as quantum circuits. In this article, we introduce an improved method for constructing quantum circuits for 4-valent Ising spin networks, which utilizes a smaller number of qubits than previous approaches. This has practical implications for the implementation of quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the procedure with various examples, including the construction of a 10-node Ising spin network state. The key ingredient of the method is the variational transfer of partial states, which we illustrate through numerous examples. Our improved construction provides a promising avenue for further exploring the potential of quantum computing methods in quantum gravity research.
