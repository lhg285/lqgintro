#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Reflected Waves and Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Leonardo Chataignier, Alexander Yu. Kamenshchik, Alessandro Tronconi, Giovanni Venturi
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04927)
 - **Abstract**
 In the context of canonical quantum gravity, we consider the effects of a non-standard expression for the gravitational wave function on the evolution of inflationary perturbations. Such an expression and its effects may be generated by a sudden variation in the (nearly constant) inflaton potential. The resulting primordial spectra, up to the leading order, are affected in the short and in the long wavelength regime, where an oscillatory behavior with a non-negligible amplitude is superimposed on the standard semiclassical result. Moreover, a novel, non-perturbative, approach is used to study the evolution. Finally, a simplified application is fully illustrated and commented.

#### **3D Quantum Gravity from Holomorphic Blocks**
 - **Authors:** Etera R. Livine, Qiaoyin Pan
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04855](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04855)
 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional gravity is a topological field theory, which can be quantized as the Ponzano-Regge state-sum model built from the $\{3nj\}$-symbols of the recoupling of the $\SU(2)$ representations, in which spins are interpreted as quantized edge lengths in Planck units. It describes the flat spacetime as gluing of three-dimensional cells with a fixed boundary metric encoding length scale. In this paper, we revisit the Ponzano-Regge model formulated in terms of spinors and rewrite the quantum geometry of 3D cells with holomorphic recoupling symbols. These symbols, known as Schwinger's generating function for the $\{6j\}$-symbols, are simply the squared inverse of the partition function of the 2D Ising model living on the boundary of the 3D cells. They can furthermore be interpreted, in their critical regime, as scale-invariant basic elements of geometry. We show how to glue them together into a discrete topological quantum field theory. This reformulation of the path integral for 3D quantum gravity, with a rich pole structure of the elementary building blocks, opens a new door toward the study of phase transitions and continuum limits in 3D quantum gravity, and offers a new twist on the construction of a duality between 3D quantum gravity and a 2d conformal theory.

#### **Towards anisotropic cosmology in group field theory**
 - **Authors:** Andrea Calcinari, Steffen Gielen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03149)
 - **Abstract**
 In cosmological group field theory (GFT) models for quantum gravity coupled to a massless scalar field the total volume, seen as a function of the scalar field, follows the classical Friedmann dynamics of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe at low energies while resolving the Big Bang singularity at high energies. An open question is how to generalise these results to other homogeneous cosmologies. Here we take the first steps towards studying anisotropic Bianchi models in GFT, based on the introduction of a new anisotropy observable analogous to the $\beta$ variables in Misner's parametrisation. In a classical Bianchi I spacetime, $\beta$ behaves as a massless scalar field and can be used as a (gravitational) relational clock. We construct a GFT model for which in an expanding Universe $\beta$ initially behaves like its classical analogue before "decaying" showing a previously studied isotropisation. We support numerical results in GFT by analytical approximations in a toy model. One possible outcome of our work is a definition of relational dynamics in GFT that does not require matter.
