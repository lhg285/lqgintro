 - **Abstract**
 A recent covariant formulation, that includes non-perturbative effects from loop quantum gravity (LQG) as self-consistent effective models, has revealed the possibility of non-singular black hole solutions. The new framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation in the presence of quantum space-time effects while respecting general covariance. Standard methods to derive particle production both within the geometric optics approximation and the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling approach are therefore available and confirm the thermal nature of Hawking radiation. The covariant description of scale-dependent decreasing holonomy corrections maintains Hawking temperature as well as universality of the low-energy transmission coefficients, stating that the absorption rates are proportional to the horizon area at leading order. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. Nevertheless, they do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation: whether a black-to-white-hole transition, or a stable remnant, is preferred. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.
