#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Loop quantum cosmological model from ADM Hamiltonian**
 - **Authors:** You Ding, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13159)
 - **Abstract**
 The loop quantum cosmological model from ADM Hamiltonian is studied in this paper. We consider the spatially flat homogeneous FRW model. It turns out that the modified Friedmann equation keeps the same form as the APS LQC model. However, the critical matter density for the bounce point is only a quarter of the previous APS model, i.e. $\rho_{cL}=\frac{\rho_c}{4}$. This is interesting because the lower critical bounce density means the quantum gravity effects will get involved earlier than the previous LQC model. Besides, the lower critical density also means the detection of quantum gravity effects easier than the previous model.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Regularizations and quantum dynamics in loop quantum cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Maciej Kowalczyk, Tomasz Pawłowski
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12527)
 - **Abstract**
 One of critical components of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and Cosmology (LQC) -- Thiemann regularization procedure is non-unique. Different choices of particular prescriptions lead to models which differ in both mathematical structure and physical predictions. Here we briefly recall a set of such prescriptions proposed in the literature in context of isotropic LQC on the example of a flat universe with massless scalar matter content. For the one least investigated so far, further called Yang-Ding-Ma prescription, a detailed analysis of its mathematical structure and resulting quantum dynamics is performed, confirming and extending the results obtained so far by phenomenological methods. In order to probe the dynamics, a relatively robust method (working in the approximation of the macroscopic universe) of evaluating quantum trajectories is devised. Said method is a variant of a semiclassical treatment that allows to express the trajectories analytically as function of internal clock and a set of certain central moments -- constants of motion encoding quantum corrections up to arbitrary order in systematic manner. As a test of method's robustness analogous evaluation of the quantum trajectory in volume is performed for those of other prescriptions, for which it is applicable. The limitations of the treatment are further briefly discussed.
