#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quasinormal modes of loop quantum black holes near the Planck scale**
 - **Authors:** Douglas M. Gingrich
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00722)
 - **Abstract**
 We compare four loop quantum gravity inspired black hole metrics near the Planck scale. Spin 0, 1/2, 1, and 2 field perturbations on these backgrounds are studied. The axial gravitational quasinormal modes are calculated and compared. The time evolution of the ringdown is examined. We also calculate the quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and compare with the predictions from circular null geodesics. 

#### **Quantum geometric formulation of Brans-Dicke theory for Bianchi I  spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Manabendra Sharma, Gustavo S. Vicente, Leila L. Graef, Rudnei O. Ramos, Anzhong Wang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01080](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01080)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider a formulation of the Brans-Dicke theory in Jordan's frame for Bianchi-I spacetime within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified. We also present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics. In particular, starting with a detailed constraint analysis, we present the off-shell Lie algebra of the full theory in the geometrodynamic phase space. This is followed by casting the theory in terms of the Yang-Mills phase space variables suitable for invoking loop quantization and show that the system is highly nonlinear. Finally, we present the quantum-corrected effective dynamics that resolve the initial singularity 

#### **Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Steffen Gielen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01790](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01790)
 - **Abstract**
 Invited contribution to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics (2nd edition), providing an overview over some main ideas and results in quantum cosmology. Key points: Canonical quantisation of homogeneous, isotropic cosmology; discussion of ambiguities in this quantisation; Construction of explicit solutions, attempts at physical interpretation; conceptual issues (time evolution, unitarity, probability interpretation); Introduction of scalar fields or perfect fluids; Discussion of whether classical singularities are resolved; Addition of inhomogeneities, possible predictions for primordial cosmology; Connections to string theory and loop quantum gravity.

#### **$\mathbb{Z}_N$ Duality and Parafermions Revisited**
 - **Authors:** Zhihao Duan, Qiang Jia, Sungjay Lee
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01913)
 - **Abstract**
 Given a two-dimensional bosonic theory with a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the orbifolding and fermionization can be understood holographically using three-dimensional BF theory with level $2$. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the information of dualities is encoded in a topological boundary state which is defined as an eigenstate of certain Wilson loop operators (anyons) in the bulk. We generalize this story to two-dimensional theories with non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, focusing on parafermionization. We find the generic operators defining different topological boundary states including orbifolding and parafermionization with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ or subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and discuss their algebraic properties as well as the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ duality web.
