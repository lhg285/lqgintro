#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Cosmological states in loop quantum gravity on homogeneous graphs**
 - **Authors:** Bekir Baytas, Nelson Yokomizo
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16439)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a class of states characterized by proposed conditions of homogeneity and isotropy in loop quantum gravity and construct concrete examples given by Bell-network states on a special class of homogeneous graphs. Such states provide new representations of cosmological spaces that can be explored for the formulation of cosmological models in the context of loop quantum gravity. We show that their local geometry is described in an automorphism-invariant manner by one-node observables analogous to the one-body observables used in many-body quantum mechanics, and compute the density matrix representing the restriction of global states to the algebra of one-node observables. The von Neumann entropy of this density matrix provides a notion of entanglement entropy of a local region which respects automorphism-invariance and can be applied to states involving superpositions of distinct graphs. 

#### **Probing Effective Loop Quantum Gravity on Weak Gravitational Lensing,  Hawking Radiation and Bounding Greybody Factor by Black Holes**
 - **Authors:** Wajiha Javed, Mehak Atique, Ali Övgün
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17277](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17277)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the weak deflection angle of black hole in effective loop quantum gravity using the geometrical technique used by Gibbons and Werner. We first derive the optical metric, calculate the Gaussian optical curvature, and then apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We then also investigate the effect of plasma and dark matter mediums on the weak deflection angle. We show that increasing the impact of these two mediums grows the deflection angle. We also calculate the Hawking temperature via Gauss-Bonnet theorem. In addition, we determine the fermionic greybody bounds. Moreover, we discuss the graphical behaviour of the deflection angle and bounds on the greybody factor. Graphically, we observe that taking $0 < A_{\lambda} < 1$ angle ranges from negative values to maximum values and also attain maximum value for these values of $ A_{\lambda}$ and for $A_{\lambda} \geq 1$ exponentially approaches to zero. Later, we graphically investigate that the greybody factor bound exhibits the convergent behaviour by converging to $1$. We also examine that the results obtained for the black hole in effective loop quantum gravity are reduced to the Schwarzschild black hole solutions when the dimensionless non-negative parameter is equal to zero $A_{\lambda}=0$.
