#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Anomaly free quantum dynamics for Euclidean LQG**
 - **Authors:** Madhavan Varadarajan
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10779)
 - **Abstract**
 Classical gravitational evolution admits an elegant and compact re-expression in terms of gauge covariant generalizations of Lie derivatives with respect to a spatial phase space dependent $su(2)$ valued vector field called the Electric Shift [1]. A quantum dynamics for Euclidean Loop Quantum Gravity which ascribes a central role to the Electric Shift operator is derived in [2]. $Here\; we\; show\; that\; this \;quantum\; dynamics\; is\; nontrivially\; anomaly$ $free$. Specifically, we show that on a suitable space of off shell states (a) the (non-vanishing) commutator between a pair of Hamiltonian constraint operators mirrors the Poisson bracket between their classical correspondents, (b) the group of finite spatial diffeomorphisms is faithfully represented and (c) the action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is diffeomorphism covariant with respect to the action of spatial diffeomorphisms. 

#### **Spin network entanglement: coarse-graining**
 - **Authors:** Qian Chen
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11205](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11205)
 - **Abstract**
 In loop quantum gravity, partitioning graph introduces boundaries and entanglement between spin sub-networks, reflecting non-local degrees of freedom and correlation amongst spatial regions. This gives rise to the view of coarse-graining, reducing the degrees of freedom that are unnecessary to be considered. The present work sets coarse-graining in the framework of bulk-boundary relation. We investigates the spin network entanglement, showing that the entanglement is invariant under the coarse-graining at kinematical level. Moreover, we build the transformation between holonomy operators based on finer graph and coarser graph, and reveal the preservation of the coarse-graining method under the evolution generated by the holonomy operator. This leads to a holographical perspective for the entanglement issue in loop quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The thermodynamics of isolated horizon in higher dimensional loop  quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Shupeng Song, Gaoping Long, Cong Zhang, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09984)
 - **Abstract**
 The statistical mechanical calculation of the thermodynamical properties of higher-dimensional non-rotating isolated horizons is studied in the loop quantum gravity framework. By employing the Hawking temperature and horizon mass of isolated horizons as physical input, the microcanonical ensemble associated with the system are well established. As a result, the black hole entropy and other thermodynamical quantities can be computed and consistent with well known Hawking's semiclassical analysis. Moreover, the value of the Immirzi parameter of higher-dimensional loop quantum gravity is also obtained.
