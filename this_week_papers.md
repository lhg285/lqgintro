#### **Title:
          Comparing Analytic and Numerical Studies of Tensor Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Antonio Vicente-Becerril, Jesús Yébana Carrilero
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the implications of different quantization approaches in Loop Quantum Cosmology for the primordial power spectrum of tensor modes. Specifically, we consider the hybrid and dressed metric approaches to derive the effective mass that governs the evolution of the tensor modes. Our study comprehensively examines the two resulting effective masses and how to estimate them in order to obtain approximated analytic solutions to the tensor perturbation equations. Since Loop Quantum Cosmology incorporates preinflationary effects in the dynamics of the perturbations, we do not have at our disposal a standard choice of privileged vacuum, like the Bunch--Davies state in quasi-de Sitter inflation. We then select the vacuum state by a recently proposed criterion which removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum and guarantees an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the ultraviolet. This vacuum is usually called the NO-AHD (from the initials of Non-Oscillating with Asymptotic Hamiltonian Diagonalization) vacuum. Consequently, we compute the power spectrum by using our analytic approximations and by introducing a suitable numerical procedure, adopting in both cases an NO-AHD vacuum. With this information, we compare the different spectra obtained from the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches, as well as from the analytic and numerical procedures. In particular, this proves the remarkable accuracy of our~approximations.

#### **Title:
          Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects**
 - **Authors:** Tieguang Zi, Shailesh Kumar
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMR waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.
