 - **Abstract**
 In this review, we investigate the question of backreaction in different
approaches to cosmological perturbation theory, and with a special focus on
quantum theoretical aspects. By backreaction we refer here to the effects of
matter field or cosmological inhomogeneities on the homogeneous dynamical
background degrees of freedom of cosmology. We begin with an overview of
classical cosmological backreaction which is ideally suited for physical
situations in the late time Universe. We then proceed backwards in time,
considering semiclassical approaches such as semiclassical or stochastic
(semiclassical) gravity which take quantum effects of the perturbations into
account. Finally, we review approaches to backreaction in quantum cosmology
that should apply to the very early Universe where classical and semiclassical
approximations break down. The main focus is on a recently proposed
implementation of backreaction in quantum cosmology using a Born-Oppenheimer
inspired method.
