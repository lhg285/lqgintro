#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Tunneling wavefunction proposal with loop quantum geometry effects**
 - **Authors:** Meysam Motaharfar, Parampreet Singh
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14065](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14065)
 - **Abstract**
 In Vilenkin's tunneling wavefunction proposal our expanding universe is born via a tunneling through a barrier from nothing at the zero scale factor. We explore the viability of this proposal for the spatially closed FLRW model with a positive cosmological constant including quantum gravity modifications in the Planck regime. Our setting is the effective spacetime description of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) which is known to replace the big bang singularity with a bounce due to the holonomy modifications. Due to the bounce, the barrier potential of the Wheeler-DeWitt theory is replaced by a step like potential which makes the tunneling proposal incompatible. But for a complete picture of singularity resolution, inverse scale factor modifications from quantum geometry must be included which play an important role at very small scale factors in the spatially closed models. We show that with inclusion of inverse scale factor modifications the resulting potential is again a barrier potential. The universe at the vanishing scale factor is dynamically non-singular and in an Einstein static like phase. We show that quantum geometric effects in LQC provide a non-singular completion of Vilenkin's tunneling proposal. We also find that quantum geometric effects result in a possibility of a tunneling to a quantum cyclic universe albeit for a very large value of cosmological constant determined by the quantum geometry. 

#### **Non-existence of quantum black hole horizons in the improved dynamics  approach**
 - **Authors:** Wen-Cong Gan, Xiao-Mei Kuang, Zhen-Hao Yang, Yungui Gong, Anzhong Wang, Bin Wang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations that black hole horizons used to appear in the classical theory within the framework of the improved dynamic approach, in which the two polymerization parameters of the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime are functions of the phase variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist any longer, and the corresponding Kantowski-Sachs model now describes the entire spacetime of the trapped region, instead of being only the internal region of a black hole, as it is usually expected in loop quantum gravity. 

#### Spin foam related papers

#### **Spinfoams and high performance computing**
 - **Authors:** Pietro Dona, Muxin Han, Hongguang Liu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14396)
 - **Abstract**
 Numerical methods are a powerful tool for doing calculations in spinfoam theory. We review the major frameworks available, their definition, and various applications. We start from $\texttt{sl2cfoam-next}$, the state-of-the-art library to efficiently compute EPRL spin foam amplitudes based on the booster decomposition. We also review two alternative approaches based on the integration representation of the spinfoam amplitude: Firstly, the numerical computations of the complex critical points discover the curved geometries from the spinfoam amplitude and provides important evidence of resolving the flatness problem in the spinfoam theory. Lastly, we review the numerical estimation of observable expectation values based on the Lefschetz thimble and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method, with the EPRL spinfoam propagator as an example.
