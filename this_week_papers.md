#### **Reduced Phase Space Quantization of Black Hole, Path Integral, and  Effective Dynamics**
 - **Authors:** Cong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08202)
 - **Abstract**
 We consider the loop quantum theory of the spherically symmetric model of gravity coupled to Gaussian dusts, where the Guassian dusts provide a material reference frame of the space and time to deparameterize gravity. This theory, used to study the quantum features of the spherically symmetric BH, is constructed based on an 1-dimensional lattice $\gamma\subset\mathbb R$. Taking advantage of the path integral formulation, we investigate the quantum dynamics and obtain an effective action. With this action, we get an effective continuous description of this quantum lattice system which is not the same as the one described by the effective Hamiltonian used in arXiv:2012.05729, i.e. the classical Hamiltonian with the holonomy correction. It turns out that, the Hamiltonian derived in this paper can return to that used in arXiv:2012.05729 only for macro black holes, since the lattice $\gamma$ should be chosen sufficiently fine. Moreover, the lattice is chosen sufficiently fine so that the continuous description can describe the underlying lattice theory well.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Backreaction in Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** S. Schander, T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** ['gr-qc', 'hep-th', 'math-ph', 'math.MP', 'quant-ph']
 - **Arxiv link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06043v1)
 - **Abstract**
 In this review, we investigate the question of backreaction in different
approaches to cosmological perturbation theory, and with a special focus on
quantum theoretical aspects. By backreaction we refer here to the effects of
matter field or cosmological inhomogeneities on the homogeneous dynamical
background degrees of freedom of cosmology. We begin with an overview of
classical cosmological backreaction which is ideally suited for physical
situations in the late time Universe. We then proceed backwards in time,
considering semiclassical approaches such as semiclassical or stochastic
(semiclassical) gravity which take quantum effects of the perturbations into
account. Finally, we review approaches to backreaction in quantum cosmology
that should apply to the very early Universe where classical and semiclassical
approximations break down. The main focus is on a recently proposed
implementation of backreaction in quantum cosmology using a Born-Oppenheimer
inspired method.
