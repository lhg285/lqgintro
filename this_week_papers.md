 - **Abstract**
 Effective models of quantum black holes inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) have had success in resolving the classical singularity with polymerisation procedures and by imposing the LQG area gap as a minimum area. The singularity is replaced by a hypersurface of transition from black to white holes, and a recent example is the Ashtekar, Olmedo and Singh (AOS) model for a Schwarzschild black hole. More recently, a one-parameter model, with equal masses for the black and white solutions, was suggested by Alonso-Bardaji, Brizuela and Vera (ABBV). An interesting feature of their quantisation is that the angular part of the metric retains its classical form and the horizon area is therefore the same as in the classical theory. In the present contribution we solve the dynamical equations derived from the ABBV effective Hamiltonian and, by applying the AOS minimal area condition, we obtain the scaling of the polymerisation parameter with the black hole mass. We than show that this effective model can also describe Planck scale black holes, and that the curvature and quantum corrections at the horizon are small even at this scale.
