 - **Abstract**
 Spin network states are a powerful tool for constructing the $SU(2)$ gauge theories on a graph. In loop quantum gravity (LQG), they have yielded many promising predictions, although progress has been limited by the computational challenge of dealing with high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. To explore more general configurations, quantum computing methods can be applied by representing spin network states as quantum circuits. In this article, we introduce an improved method for constructing quantum circuits for 4-valent Ising spin networks, which utilizes a smaller number of qubits than previous approaches. This has practical implications for the implementation of quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the procedure with various examples, including the construction of a 10-node Ising spin network state. The key ingredient of the method is the variational transfer of partial states, which we illustrate through numerous examples. Our improved construction provides a promising avenue for further exploring the potential of quantum computing methods in quantum gravity research.
