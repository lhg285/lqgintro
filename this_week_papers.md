 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate, in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity, the Quantum Holographic Principle, according to which the area of the boundary surface enclosing a region of space encodes a qubit per Planck unit. To this aim, we introduce fermion fields in the bulk, whose boundary surface is the two-dimensional sphere. The doubling of the fermionic degrees of freedom and the use of the Bogoljubov transformations lead to pairs of spin network's edges piercing the boundary surface with double punctures, giving rise to pixels of area encoding a qubit. The proof is also valid in the case of a fuzzy sphere.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **An Overview on the Nature of the Bounce in LQC and PQM**
 - **Authors:** Gabriele Barca, Eleonora Giovannetti, Giovanni Montani
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08645)
 - **Abstract**
 We present a review on basic aspects of quantum cosmology in the presence of cut-off physics. We first analyze how the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a pure metric approach describes the quantum Universe, showing how the singularity is not removed. We then discuss basic features of loop quantum cosmology. For the isotropic Universe, we compare the original $\mu_0$ scheme and the most commonly accepted formulation, the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme. Some results concerning the Bianchi Universes are also discussed. Finally, we consider some relevant criticisms on the real link between full loop quantum gravity and its minisuperspace implementation. In the second part of the review we consider the isotropic Universe and the Bianchi models in the framework of polymer quantum mechanics. We first address the polymerization in terms of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection and show how the resulting dynamics is isomorphic to the $\mu_0$. Then we analyze the polymerization of volume-like variables, and we see the resulting dynamics is isomorphic to the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme with a fixed critical energy density. Finally, we consider the polymer quantum dynamics of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Mixmaster model through a metric approach. We compare the results obtained by using the volume variable to the standard Misner variable. In the latter case we find a cosmology that is still singular, and its chaotic properties depend on the ratio between the lattice steps for the isotropic and anisotropic variables. We conclude the review with some considerations on changing variables in the polymer representation. In particular we consider how the dynamics can be mapped in two different sets of variables (at the price of using a coordinate-dependent lattice step), and we infer some possible implications on the equivalence of the $\mu_0$ and $\bar{\mu}$ scheme of loop quantum cosmology.
