#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

There is no new related paper today 

#### Spin foam related papers

#### **A new 2+1 coherent spin-foam vertex for quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** José Diogo Simão
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05993](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05993)
 - **Abstract**
 We propose an explicit spin-foam amplitude for Lorentzian gravity in three dimensions. The model is based on two main requirements: that it should be structurally similar to its well-known Euclidean analog, and that geometricity should be recovered in the semiclassical regime. To this end we introduce new coherent states for space-like 1-dimensional boundaries, derived from the continuous series of unitary $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representations. We show that the relevant objects in the amplitude can be written in terms of the defining representation of the group, just as so happens in the Euclidean case. We derive an expression for the semiclassical amplitude at large spins, showing that it relates to the Lorentzian Regge action.
