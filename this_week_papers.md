#### **Space-like Singularities of General Relativity: A Phantom menace?**
 - **Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar, Adrián del Río, Marc Schneider
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00298](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00298)
 - **Abstract**
 The big bang and the Schwarzschild singularities are space-like. They are generally regarded as the "final frontiers" at which space-time ends and general relativity breaks down. We review the status of such space-like singularities from three increasingly more general perspectives. They are provided by (i) A reformulation of classical general relativity motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov, Lifshitz conjecture on the behavior of the gravitational field near space-like singularities; (ii) The use of test quantum fields to probe the nature of these singularities; and, (iii) An analysis of the fate of these singularities in loop quantum gravity due to quantum geometry effects. At all three levels singularities turn out to be less menacing than one might a priori expect from classical general relativity. Our goal is to present an overview of the emerging conceptual picture and suggest lines for further work. In line with the \emph{Introduction to Current Research} theme, we have made an attempt to make it easily accessible to all researchers in gravitational physics.
