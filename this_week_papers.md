 - **Abstract**
 To date, a mathematically consistent construction of effective rotating black hole models in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is still lacking. In this work, we start with the assumption that rotating LQG black hole metrics can be effectively obtained using Newman-Janis Algorithm. Then, based on a few extra fair assumptions on the seed metric functions, we make a conjecture on what a rotating LQG black hole would generically look like. Our general arguments and conclusions can be supported by some known specific examples in the literature.
