#### **On the discrete version of the Reissner-Nordström solution**
 - **Authors:** V.M. Khatsymovsky
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13823)
 - **Abstract**
 This paper generalizes our previous paper on the discrete Schwarzschild type solution in the Regge calculus, the simplicial electrodynamics earlier considered in the literature is incorporated in the case of the presence of a charge. Validity of the path integral approach is assumed, of which the only consequence used here is a loose fixation of edge lengths around a finite nonzero scale (we have considered the latter earlier). In essence, the problem of determining the optimal background metric and electromagnetic field for the perturbative expansion generated by the functional integral is considered, for which the skeleton Regge and electrodynamic equations are analyzed. For the Regge equations, as we have earlier found, the Regge action on the simplest periodic simplicial structure and in the leading order over metric variations between 4-simplices can be substituted by a finite-difference form of the Hilbert-Einstein action (the piecewise constant metric there is defined by providing the vertices with coordinates). Thus we get the absence of the singularity inherent in the continuous solution. At the same time, the discrete solution is close to the continuum Reissner-Nordstr\"om one at large distances.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Effective dynamics of scalar cosmological perturbations from quantum  gravity**
 - **Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Daniele Oriti
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12677](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12677)
 - **Abstract**
 We derive an effective dynamics for scalar cosmological perturbations from quantum gravity, in the framework of group field theory (GFT) condensate cosmology. The emergent spacetime picture is obtained from the mean field hydrodynamic regime of the fundamental theory, and physical observables are defined using a relational strategy applied at the same level of approximation, in terms of suitable collective states of the GFT field. The dynamical equations we obtain for volume and matter perturbations lead to the same solutions as those of classical general relativity in the long-wavelength, super-horizon limit, but differ in other regimes. These differences could be of phenomenological interest and make contact between fundamental quantum gravity models and cosmological observations, indicating new physics or limitations of the fundamental models or of the approximations leading to the effective cosmological dynamics.
