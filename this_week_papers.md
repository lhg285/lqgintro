#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **On the initial state of the universe in Loop Quantum Cosmology and the  time arrow**
 - **Authors:** Carlos Silva, Renan Arag√£o, Francisco A. Brito
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05670](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05670)
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we address the thermodynamical evolution of the universe in the context of Loop Quantum Cosmology by considering the conditions for the existence of a time arrow in this approach. We find out that, for the existence of a time arrow in our universe, in terms of its obedience to the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics, the initial state of the cosmos must correspond to a negative entropy one. 

#### **Quantization of spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity coupled to a  scalar field and a clock: the asymptotic limit**
 - **Authors:** Rodolfo Gambini, Jorge Pullin
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05766)
 - **Abstract**
 We continue our work on the study of spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity coupled to two spherically symmetric scalar fields, one which acts as a clock. As a consequence of the presence of the latter, we can define a true Hamiltonian for the theory. The spherically symmetric context allows to carry out precise detailed calculations. Here we study the theory for regions of large values of the radial coordinate. This allows us to define in detail the vacuum of the theory and study its quantum states, yielding a quantum field theory on a quantum space time that makes contact with the usual treatment on classical space times.
