 - **Abstract**
 We provide non-trivial checks of the recently proposed duality between double-scaled SYK and a 2d dilaton gravity model with sine potential, studying the path integral at one-loop level. Specifically, we compute the logarithmic correction to the free energy of sine-dilaton gravity and, up to potential ordering ambiguities, we find a match with the corresponding quantity in double-scaled SYK. The computation relies on the description of sine-dilaton gravity in terms of a version of the q-Schwarzian theory, the quantum deformation of the standard Schwarzian model dual to JT gravity. A crucial aspect of the calculation is selecting the correct Hartle-Hawking vacuum for the gravitational theory, which implies a specific choice of boundary conditions for the one-loop determinant, computed using a generalization of the Gel'fand-Yaglom's theorem. We also evaluate the gravitational one-loop correction to the boundary to boundary propagator of a non-minimally coupled matter field in the bulk theory, showing a perfect agreement with the corresponding quantum correction of matter correlators in double-scaled SYK.
