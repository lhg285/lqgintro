#### Spin foam related papers

#### **Spin foam amplitude of the black-to-white hole transition**
 - **Authors:** Muxin Han, Dongxue Qu, Cong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02796](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02796)
 - **Abstract**
 It has been conjectured that quantum gravity effects may cause the black-to-white hole transition due to quantum tunneling. The transition amplitude of this process is explored within the framework of the spin foam model on a 2-complex containing 56 vertices. We develop a systematic way to construct the bulk triangulation from the boundary triangulation to obtain the 2-complex. By using Thiemann's complexifier coherent state as the boundary state to resemble the semiclassical geometry, we introduce a procedure to calculate the parameters labeling the coherent state from the continuous curved geometry. Considering that triad fields of different orientations, i.e., $e_i^a$ and $-e_i^a$, give the same intrinsic geometry of the boundary, we creatively adopt the boundary state as a superposition of the coherent states associated with both orientations. We employ the method of complex critical point to numerically compute the transition amplitude. Despite the numerical results, it is interestingly found that the transition amplitude is dominated by the terms allowing the change in orientation. This suggests that the black-to-white hole transition should be accompanied by quantum tunneling process of a change in orientation.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Decoding quantum gravity information with black hole accretion disk**
 - **Authors:** Lei You, Yu-Hang Feng, Rui-Bo Wang, Jian-Bo Deng, Xian-Ru Hu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01418)
 - **Abstract**
 The combination of Loop Quantum Gravity theory with the classical gravitational collapse model has effectively addressed the singularity problem of black holes and predicted the emergence of white holes in the late stages of collapse. The quantum extension of Kruskal spacetime suggests that the appearance of white holes may carry information from companion black holes in the universe earlier than ours. Photons emitted from the accretion disk of companion black holes will enter the companion black hole, traverse through quantum regions from the white hole to our universe, and produce imaging of accretion disk carrying quantum gravity information. In our work, we have obtained the accretion disk images of black hole from a universe earlier than ours, transported by a white hole within our universe, along with the positions and widths of these images exactly. Remarkably, behaviours of white hole and black hole imaging are similar in photon sphere and contrary to some cases of outside. This will provide valuable references for astronomical observations to validate quantum gravity theory.
