 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field (QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.
