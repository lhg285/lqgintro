 - **Abstract**
 The destruction of the event horizon of a nonsingular black hole, which is not prevented by the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, might provide us the possibility to access quantum regime of gravity inside black hole. We investigate the possibility of overspinning a nonsingular rotating quantum-corrected black hole by a test particle and a scalar field in this paper, and analyse the effect of the quantum parameter on the destruction of the event horizon. For the test particle injection, both extremal and near-extremal black holes cannot be overspun due to the existence of the quantum parameter. And the larger the quantum parameter the harder the black hole to be overspun. It seems that the quantum parameter acts as a protector to prevent the black hole to be destroyed. However, for the test scalar field scattering, both extremal and near-extremal black holes can be destroyed. Due to the loop quantum gravity correction, the angular velocity of the extremal black hole shifts from that of the extremal Kerr black hole. This provides a small range of wave modes to destroy the event horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole.
