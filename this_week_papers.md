#### **Title:
          Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics**
 - **Authors:** Marco Calzà, Davide Pedrotti, Sunny Vagnozzi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph**
 - **Authors:** Bekir Baytaş, Nelson Yokomizo
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Bell-network states are a class of entangled states of the geometry that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in a limit of large spins and are automorphism-invariant, for arbitrary graphs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. Our main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the average geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat tetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy relations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is accompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the dihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.
