#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Gravitational waves for eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals of  self-dual spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Yunlong Liu, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08454)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we calculate the frequencies of geodesic orbits in self-dual spacetime on the equatorial plane and obtain the leading-order effects of loop quantum parameters $P$ on the energy flux and angular momentum flux in eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals. The gravitational waveform under different eccentricity is carried out by improved "analytic-kludge" method. Through the calculation of waveform mismatches for the LISA detector, the constraints on loop quantum parameters will be improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, compared to the weak field experiments in the solar system, and can reach the level of $10^{-8}$.
