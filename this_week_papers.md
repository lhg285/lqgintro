 - **Abstract**
 Spin foam theory is a concrete framework for quantum gravity where numerical calculations of transition amplitudes are possible. Recently, the field became very active, but the entry barrier is steep, mainly because of its unusual language and notions scattered around the literature. This paper is a pedagogical guide to spin foam transition amplitude calculations. We show how to write an EPRL-FK transition amplitude, from the definition of the 2-complex to its numerical implementation using \texttt{sl2cfoam-next}. We guide the reader using an explicit example balancing mathematical rigor with a practical approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and provide a novel look at a recently proposed approximation scheme.
