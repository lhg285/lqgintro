#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations**
 - **Authors:** G. L. L. W. Levy, José A. Helayël-Neto
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Static and stationary loop quantum black bounces**
 - **Authors:** C.R. Muniz, G. Alencar, M.S. Cunha, Gonzalo J. Olmo
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We explore a static and stationary black bounce geometry inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), focusing on how LQG corrections and regularization parameters affect its properties. Building on the spherically symmetric and static black hole solution from \cite{Kelly:2020uwj}, we trace its origin to Non-Linear Electrodynamics (NED) with electric and magnetic charges and check the energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC). By extending the geometry using the Simpson-Visser procedure, we construct a black hole-wormhole bounce structure, influenced by LQG parameters. We analyze the horizon structure to constrain parameters for black holes and wormholes, and examine curvature and new sources including a phantom-type scalar field to ensure spacetime regularity and adherence to energy conditions. Thermodynamic properties are also studied, revealing the existence of remnants and phase transitions. Additionally, we derive a rotating black bounce solution, verifying its regularity, and putting forward that the spherical bouncing surface turns into an ellipsoid with no ring singularity. Finally, we find that increasing the LQG parameter leads to smaller ergospheres and reduced shadows, with potential implications for observational astrophysics and quantum gravitational signatures.
