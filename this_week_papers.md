 - **Abstract**
 A new family of coherent states for all dimensional loop quantum gravity are proposed, which is based on the generalized twisted geometry parametrization of the phase space of $SO(D+1)$ connection theory. We prove that this family of coherent states provide an over-complete basis of the Hilbert space in which edge simplicity constraint is solved. Moreover, according to our explicit calculation, the expectation values of holonomy and flux operators with respect to this family of coherent states coincide with the corresponding classical values given by the labels of the coherent states, up to some gauge degrees of freedom. Besides, we study the peakedness properties of this family of coherent states, including the peakedness of the wave functions of this family of coherent states in holonomy, momentum and phase space representations. It turns out that the peakedness in these various representations and the (relative) uncertainty of the expectation values of the operators are well controlled by the semi-classical parameter $t$. Therefore, this family of coherent states provide a candidate for the semi-classical analysis of all dimensional loop quantum gravity.

#### **Finiteness of spinfoam vertex amplitude with timelike polyhedra, and the  full amplitude**

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on Conrady-Hnybida's 4-dimensional extended spinfoam model with timelike polyhedra, while we restrict all faces to be spacelike. Firstly, we prove the absolute convergence of the vertex amplitude with timelike polyhedra, when SU(1,1) boundary states are coherent states or the canonical basis, or their finite linear combinations. Secondly, based on the finite vertex amplitude and a proper prescription of the SU(1,1) intertwiner space, we construct the extended spinfoam amplitude on arbitrary cellular complex, taking into account the sum over SU(1,1) intertwiners of internal timelike polyhedra. We observe that the sum over SU(1,1) intertwiners is infinite for the internal timelike polyhedron that has at least 2 future-pointing and 2 past-pointing face-normals. In order to regularize the possible divergence from summing over SU(1,1) intertwiners, we develop a quantum cut-off scheme based on the eigenvalue of the ``shadow operator''. The spinfoam amplitude with timelike internal polyhedra (and spacelike faces) is finite, when 2 types of cut-offs are imposed: one is imposed on $j$ the eigenvalue of area operator, the other is imposed on the eigenvalue of shadow operator for every internal timelike polyhedron that has at least 2 future-pointing and 2 past-pointing face-normals.
