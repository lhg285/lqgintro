#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quasicrystalline Spin Foam with Matter: Definitions and Examples**
 - **Authors:** Marcelo Amaral, Richard Clawson, Klee Irwin
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01964)
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we define quasicrystalline spin networks as a subspace within the standard Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, effectively constraining the states to coherent states that align with quasicrystal geometry structures. We introduce quasicrystalline spin foam amplitudes, a variation of the EPRL spin foam model, in which the internal spin labels are constrained to correspond to the boundary data of quasicrystalline spin networks. Within this framework, the quasicrystalline spin foam amplitudes encode the dynamics of quantum geometries that exhibit aperiodic structures. Additionally, we investigate the coupling of fermions within the quasicrystalline spin foam amplitudes. We present calculations for three-dimensional examples and then explore the 600-cell construction, which is a fundamental component of the four-dimensional Elser-Sloane quasicrystal derived from the E8 root lattice. 

#### **Spin network Entanglement and Bulk-Boundary Map in Loop Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Qian Chen
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02789)
 - **Abstract**
 This thesis is dedicated to the study of open spin networks. We formulate quasi-local descriptions of loop quantum gravity. We investigate the coarse-graining procedure via tracing over bulk degrees of freedom, which encodes all that we can know about the quantum state of geometry from probing the boundary. We prove a boundary-to bulk universal reconstruction procedure, to be understood as a purification of the mixed boundary state into a pure bulk state. We then move to define multipartite entanglement in spin networks, and show the computation of entanglement excitation from holonomy operator, which also allows us to glimpse bulk curvature from entanglement. Moreover, by investigating another coarse-graining procedure - via gauge-fixing, which does not trace over any bulk degrees of freedom, we show a new interesting connection between bulk geometry and boundary observables via the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, we define the spin network entanglement between spin sub-networks, which correspond to spatial sub-regions. We then generalize the coarse-graining approach, and prove that the entanglement between spin sub-networks is preserved under the coarse-graining (via gauge-fixing).
