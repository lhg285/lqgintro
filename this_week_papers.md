#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Effective dynamics of scalar cosmological perturbations from quantum  gravity**
 - **Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Daniele Oriti
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12677](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12677)
 - **Abstract**
 We derive an effective dynamics for scalar cosmological perturbations from quantum gravity, in the framework of group field theory (GFT) condensate cosmology. The emergent spacetime picture is obtained from the mean field hydrodynamic regime of the fundamental theory, and physical observables are defined using a relational strategy applied at the same level of approximation, in terms of suitable collective states of the GFT field. The dynamical equations we obtain for volume and matter perturbations lead to the same solutions as those of classical general relativity in the long-wavelength, super-horizon limit, but differ in other regimes. These differences could be of phenomenological interest and make contact between fundamental quantum gravity models and cosmological observations, indicating new physics or limitations of the fundamental models or of the approximations leading to the effective cosmological dynamics.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **An effective model for the quantum Schwarzschild black hole**
 - **Authors:** Asier Alonso-Bardaji, David Brizuela, Raül Vera
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12110)
 - **Abstract**
 We present an effective theory to describe the quantization of spherically symmetric vacuum in loop quantum gravity. We include anomaly-free holonomy corrections through a canonical transformation of the Hamiltonian of general relativity, such that the modified constraint algebra closes. The system is then provided with a fully covariant and unambigous geometric description, independent of the gauge choice on the phase space. The resulting spacetime corresponds to a singularity-free (black-hole/white-hole) interior and two asymptotically flat exterior regions of equal mass. The interior region contains a minimal smooth spacelike surface that replaces the Schwarzschild singularity. We find the global causal structure and the maximal analytical extension. Both Minkowski and Schwarzschild spacetimes are directly recovered as particular limits of the model.
