#### **Title:
          Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments: observational signatures and parameter constraints**
 - **Authors:** Wen-Juan Ai, Ruo-Ting Chen, Jian-Pin Wu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.

#### **Title:
          Non-associative Algebras of Cubic Matrices and their Gauge Theories**
 - **Authors:** Ralph Blumenhagen, Antonia Paraskevopoulou, Thomas Raml
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by M-theory, we define a new type of non-associative algebra involving usual and cubic matrices at the same time. The resulting algebra can be regarded as a two-term truncated $L_\infty$ algebra giving rise to a fundamental identity between the two- and the three-bracket. We provide a simple class of concrete examples of such algebras based on the structure constants of a Lie algebra. Connecting to previous results on higher structures, we generalize the construction of Yang-Mills theories, topological BF theory and generalized IKKT models and point out some appearing issues.
