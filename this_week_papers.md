 - **Abstract**
 Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to exist, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of a regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.

#### **Title:
          Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity**
 - **Authors:** A.D. López-Hernández, Graciela Reyes-Ahumada, Javier Chagoya
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Abstract**
 We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.
