#### **Title:
          Emergent modified gravity: Polarized Gowdy model on a torus**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald, Erick I. Duque
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 New covariant theories of emergent modified gravity exist not only in spherically symmetric models, as previously found, but also in polarized Gowdy systems that have a local propagating degree of freedom. Several explicit versions are derived here, depending on various modification functions. These models do not have instabilities from higher time derivatives, and a large subset is compatible with gravitational waves and minimally coupled massless matter fields travelling at the same speed. Interpreted as models of loop quantum gravity, covariant Hamiltonian constraints derived from the covariance conditions found in polarized Gowdy systems are more restricted than those in spherical symmetry, requiring new forms of holonomy modifications with an anisotropy dependence that has not been considered before. Assuming homogeneous space, the models provide access to the full anisotropy parameters of modified Bianchi I dynamics, in which case different fates of the classical singularity are realized depending on the specific class of modifications.

#### **Title:
          Spikes and spines in 4D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Johanna Borissova, Bianca Dittrich, Dongxue Qu, Marc Schiffer

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as quantum Regge calculus and spin foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while the boundary edges are kept small. Spikes and spines are prime examples for such configurations. They pose a significant challenge for a desired continuum limit, for which the average lengths of edges ought to become very small. Here we investigate spike and spine configurations in four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum Regge calculus. We find that the expectation values of arbitrary powers of the bulk length are finite. To that end, we explore new types of asymptotic regimes for the Regge amplitudes, in which some of the edges are much larger than the remaining ones. The amplitudes simplify considerably in such asymptotic regimes and the geometric interpretation of the resulting expressions involves a dimensional reduction, which might have applications to holography.

#### **Title:
          Black holes in effective loop quantum gravity: Covariant holonomy modifications**
 - **Authors:** Idrus Husin Belfaqih, Martin Bojowald, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Erick I. Duque
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Abstract**
 Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant, effective framework for obtaining spherically symmetric black hole solutions in models of loop quantum gravity with scale-dependent holonomy modifications. Exact solutions for vacuum black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant are derived here and analyzed in four different gauges, explicitly related to one another by standard coordinate transformations. The global structure is obtained by gluing space-time regions corresponding to the gauge choices, reconstructing a non-singular wormhole space-time for an arbitrary scale-dependent holonomy parameter. This outcome demonstrates the robustness of black-hole models with covariant holonomy modifications under quantization ambiguities. Compared with previous constructions, full covariance of the resulting space-time models as derived here implies subtle new effects and leads to a novel understanding of the parameters in holonomy modifications, distinguishing a constant holonomy length from a possibly scale-dependent function that may change coefficients of holonomy terms. New physical results are obtained for instance in the context of a non-trivial zero-mass limit of holonomy-modified space-times. The existence of a consistent effective space-time structure implies various novel aspects of a net gravitational stress-energy and related thermodynamical properties.
