#### **Title:
          Testing general covariance in effective models motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity**
 - **Authors:** Juan Carlos Del Águila, Hugo A. Morales
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this work we introduce a criterion for testing general covariance in effective quantum gravity theories. It adapts the criterion based on general spacetime diffeomorphisms of the Einstein-Hilbert action to the case of effective canonical models. While the main purpose is to test models obtained in Loop Quantum Gravity, the criterion is not limited to those physical systems and may be applied to any canonically formulated modified theory of gravity. The approach here is hence not that of finding an effective model, but rather to analyze a given one represented by a quantum corrected Hamiltonian. Specifically, we will apply the criterion to spherically symmetric spacetimes in the vacuum with inverse triad and holonomy modifications that arise as a consequence of the loop quantization procedure. It is found that, in addition to the initial modifications of the Hamiltonian, quantum corrections of the classical metric itself are needed as well in order to obtain generally covariant models. A comparison with a recent alternative criterion is included in the discussion.

#### **Title:
          Evolution of interior entropy of a loop quantum-corrected black hole pierced by a cosmic string**
 - **Authors:** Wei Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 The concept of interior entropy of black hole provides a possible way to deal with information problem. We derive evolution relation between interior entropy and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a loop quantum-corrected black hole with large mass pierced by an infinitely straight cosmic string during Hawking radiation. We find that the present cosmic string can influence the evolution relation between these two types of entropy under black hole evaporation and the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for the total variation of these two types of entropy.
