 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational wave emission from periodic timelike orbits of a test particle around a loop quantum gravity-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.

#### **Title:
          A class of entangled and diffeomorphism-invariant states in loop quantum gravity: Bell-network states**
 - **Authors:** Bekir Baytaş
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Bell-network states constitute a class of diffeomorphism-invariant and entangled states of the geometry within loop quantum gravity (LQG) that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in the limit of large spins. The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory.
