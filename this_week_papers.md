#### **Effective black hole interior and the Raychadhuri equation**
 - **Authors:** Keagan Blanchette, Saurya Das, Samantha Hergott, Saeed Rastgoo
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05397)
 - **Abstract**
 We show that loop quantum gravity effects leads to the finiteness of expansion and its rate of change in the effective regime in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. As a consequence the singularity is resolved.
