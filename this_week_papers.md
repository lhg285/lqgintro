 - **Abstract**
 We study a certain subalgebra of functions on the phase space of $2d$ BF theory with the gauge group $\mathrm{GL}_N$ coupled to a $1d$ quantum mechanics with global symmetry $\mathrm{GL}_K$ and its quantization. These functions are gauge-invariant local observables of the coupled theory, which appears as boundary side of an early example of twisted holography involving stacks of $N$ D2-branes and $K$ D4-branes intersecting along a real line. We give a geometric proof that the quantization of this subalgebra in the large-$N$ limit is the Yangian. The finite-$N$ subalgebra is a quotient of its large-$N$ limit by a certain ideal. We compute this ideal for $N=1$ and give an abstract characterization of the ideal for any $N$. Furthermore, we study the full algebra of functions on the phase space and prove that in the large-$N$ limit, it is the algebra of functions on the based loop group of $\mathrm{GL}_K\times \mathrm{GL}_1$. Similar to its subalgebra, the full finite-$N$ algebra is a quotient of the large-$N$ limit algebra by a certain ideal. We compute this ideal for $N=1$ and give an abstract characterization of the ideal for any $N$. Finally, we compute the Hilbert series of the full finite-$N$ algebra.
