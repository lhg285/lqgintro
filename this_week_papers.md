 - **Abstract**
 The prediction of a minimal length scale by various quantum gravity candidates (such as string/M theory, Doubly Special Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and others) have suggested modification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), resulting in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). In this short review, we investigate the origins of the GUP and examine higher-order models, focusing on the linear plus quadratic form of the GUP. We extend the concept of minimal length to minimal angular resolution, which plays a crucial role in modifying angular momentum and its associated algebra. A comparison is made between the standard angular momentum commutator algebra and that modified by the GUP. Finally, we review its application in the hydrogen atom spectra and and discuss future endeavors.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Black hole tunneling in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Hongwei Tan, Rong-Zhen Guo, Jingyi Zhang

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.
