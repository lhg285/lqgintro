#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models**
 - **Authors:** Marco Calzà, Davide Pedrotti, Guan-Wen Yuan, Sunny Vagnozzi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions. 

#### Spin foam related papers

#### **Title:
          Renormalization group flows in area-metric gravity**
 - **Authors:** Johanna Borissova, Bianca Dittrich, Astrid Eichhorn, Marc Schiffer
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We put forward the first analysis of renormalization group flows in an area-metric theory, motivated by spin-foam quantum gravity. Area-metric gravity contains the well-known length-metric degrees of freedom of standard gravity as well as additional shape-mismatching degrees of freedom. To be phenomenologically viable, the shape-mismatching degrees of freedom have to decouple under the renormalization group flow towards lower scales. We test this scenario by calculating the renormalization group flow of the masses and find that these are in general even more relevant than dictated by their canonical scaling dimension. This generically results in masses which are large compared to the Planck mass and thereby ensure the decoupling of shape-mismatching degrees of freedom. In addition, the latter come in a left-handed and right-handed sector. We find that parity symmetry does not emerge under the renormalization group flow. Finally, we extract the renormalization group flow of the Immirzi parameter from this setup and find that its beta function features zeros at vanishing as well as at infinite Immirzi parameter.
