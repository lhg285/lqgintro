 - **Abstract**
 Carrollian field theories at the classical level possess infinite number of space-time symmetries, namely the supertranslations. In this article we enquire whether these symmetries for interacting Carrollian scalar field theory survive in presence of quantum effects. For interactions polynomial in the field, the answer is in the affirmative. We also studied a renormalization group flow particularly tailored to respect the manifest Carroll invariance and analyzed the consequences of introducing Carroll-breaking deformations. The renormalization group flow, with perturbative loop level effects taken into account, indicates a new fixed point apart from the Gaussian ones.
