 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the existence of wormholes within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, considering isotropic dark matter as the matter source. We examine three distinct density profiles and employ modified field equations along with stress-energy tensor conservation, applying suitable boundary conditions to derive traversable wormhole solutions. We confirm that each obtained solution meets the geometric requirements for wormholes and assess the regularity of these spacetimes by computing the Kretschmann scalar to ensure the absence of singularities. Through the stress-energy tensor, we analyze the conditions under which energy conditions may be violated in this model. We explore the geometry of these wormholes using embedding diagrams, and evaluate the stability of the solutions by examining the speed of sound. Lastly, we compute the amount of exotic matter necessary to sustain these structures using the Volume Integral Quantifier.
