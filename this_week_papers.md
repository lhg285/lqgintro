 - **Abstract**
 The RG equation for the effective potential in the leading log (LL) approximation is constructed which is valid for an arbitrary scalar field theory in 4 dimensions. The solution to this equation sums up the leading log\phi contributions to all orders of perturbation theory. In general, this is the second order nonlinear partial differential equation, but in some cases it can be reduced to the ordinary one. For particular examples, this equation is solved numerically and the LL effective potential is constructed. The solution has a characteristic discontinuity replacing the Landau pole typical for the phi^4 theory. For a power-like potential no new minima appear due to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
