 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.
