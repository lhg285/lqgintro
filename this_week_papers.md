 - **Abstract**
 In this article, the quantum representation of the algebra among reduced twisted geometries (with respect to the Gauss constraint) is constructed in the gauge invariant Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the reduced twisted geometric variables not only describe the spatial discrete geometry more clearly, but also form a simple Poisson algebra which is analogous to that in quantum mechanics. By regularizing the reduced twisted geometric variables properly, the fundamental algebra of reduced twisted geometry is established, with the gauge invariant Hilbert space in loop quantum gravity as the corresponding quantum representation space. This quantum representation also leads to fundamental operators associated with reduced twisted geometry. Based on these fundamental operators, a new type of extrinsic curvature operator is constructed in loop quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Gentle spaghettification in effective LQG dust collapse**
 - **Authors:** Francesco Fazzini
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 Effective dust collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predicts two main features for general realistic initial profiles: a quantum gravitational bounce of the stellar core, when the energy density becomes planckian, and shell-crossing singularities, arising within almost a planckian time after the bounce. The aim of this work is to study the mathematical and physical features of the effective spacetime near these singularities, through the Jacobi deviation equation. The results show that the radial and angular deviations between dust particles remain finite at both the bounce and shell-crossing singularity, providing a physical justification for extending the spacetime beyond shell-crossing singularities through weak solutions.
