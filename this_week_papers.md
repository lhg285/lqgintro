#### **Spin current in BF theory**
 - **Authors:** Malik Matwi
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce a current which we call spin current corresponding to the variation of the matter action in BF theory with respect to the spin connection $A$ which takes values in Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(3,\mathbb{C})$ in self-dual formalism. For keeping the constraint $DB^i=0$ satisfied, we suggest adding a new term to the BF Lagrangian using a new field $\psi^i$ which can be used for calculating the spin current. We derive the equations of motion and discuss the solutions. We will see that the solutions of that equations do not require a specific metric on the manifold $M$, we just need to know the symmetry of the system and the information about the spin current. Finally we find the solutions in a spherical and cylindrical symmetric systems.

#### **Cosmic tangle: Loop quantum cosmology and CMB anomalies**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald 
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02481)
 - **Abstract:**
    Loop quantum cosmology is a conflicted field in which exuberant claims of observability coexist with serious objections against the conceptual and physical viability of its current formulations. This contribution presents a non-technical case study of the recent claim that loop quantum cosmology might alleviate anomalies in observations of the cosmic microwave background.
