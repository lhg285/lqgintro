#### **Title:
          Probing Quantum Gravity Effects with Eccentric Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals**
 - **Authors:** Guoyang Fu, Yunqi Liu, Bin Wang, Jian-Pin Wu, Chao Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Signatures from the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency for rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Zhengwei Cheng, Songbai Chen, Jiliang Jing
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the radiative efficiency and the jet power in the spacetime of the rotating black hole in loop quantum gravity (LQG), which has an extra LQG parameter. It is shown that with the increase of the LQG parameter, the conversion efficiency decreases for the slowly rotating black hole, but increases for the rapidly rotating black hole, the jet power increases for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between observational constrain parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes.

#### **Title:
          Gravitational lensing in holonomy corrected spherically symmetric black holes with phantom global monopoles**
 - **Authors:** Faizuddin Ahmed
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we address a theoretical investigation of the gravitational lensing phenomenon within the space-time framework of a holonomy-corrected spherically symmetric black hole (BH), incorporating both ordinary and phantom global monopoles. Our focus lies on the analysis of null geodesics within this black hole background, examining the influence of ordinary and phantom global monopoles on the effective potential of null geodesics of the system. Afterwards, we derive analytical expressions for the deflection angle of photon light, considering weak field limit. The obtain expressions are presented up to the second order of the Loop Quantum Gravity parameter, enabling a thorough examination of the impact of ordinary and phantom global monopoles on the deflection angle.
