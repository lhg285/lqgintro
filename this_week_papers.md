#### **Cosmic tangle: Loop quantum cosmology and CMB anomalies**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald 
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02481)
 - **Abstract:**
    Loop quantum cosmology is a conflicted field in which exuberant claims of observability coexist with serious objections against the conceptual and physical viability of its current formulations. This contribution presents a non-technical case study of the recent claim that loop quantum cosmology might alleviate anomalies in observations of the cosmic microwave background.
