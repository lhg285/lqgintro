#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum Geometry II : The Mathematics of Loop Quantum Gravity Three  dimensional quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** J.Manuel García-Islas
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09143)
 - **Abstract**
 Loop quantum gravity is a physical theory which aims at unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. It takes general relativity very seriously and modifies it via a quantisation. General relativity describes gravity in terms of geometry. Therefore, quantising such theory must be equivalent to quantising geometry and that is what loop quantum gravity does. This sounds like a mathematical task as well. This is why in this paper we will present the mathematics of loop quantum gravity. We will do it from a mathematician point of view. This paper is intended to be an introduction to loop quantum gravity for postgraduate students of physics and mathematics. In this work we will restrict ourselves to the three dimensional case. 

#### **Isospectrality of quasinormal modes in nonrotating loop quantum gravity  black holes**
 - **Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, Javier Olmedo
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09584)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the quasinormal frequencies of three effective geometries of nonrotating regular black holes derived from loop quantum gravity. Concretely, we consider the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh and two Gambini-Olmedo-Pullin prescriptions. We compute the quasinormal frequencies of axial and polar perturbations adopting a WKB method. We show that they differ from those of classical general relativity and, more importantly, that isospectrality is broken. Nevertheless, these deviations are tiny, even for microscopic black holes, and they decay following an inverse power law of the size of the mass of the black holes. For the sake of completeness, we also analyze scalar and vector perturbations, reaching similar conclusions.
