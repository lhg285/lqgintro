#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Group field theory on quantum groups**
 - **Authors:** Florian Girelli, Matteo Laudonio
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13312](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13312)
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the framework of Hopf algebra field theory (HAFT) which generalizes the notion of group field theory to the quantum group (Hopf algebra) case. We focus in particular on the 3d case and show how the HAFT we considered is topological. The highlight of the construction is the notion of plane-wave which leads, in the specific example of SUq (2) with q real, to a discretization of the Euclidian BF action with a negative cosmological constant. This work can be viewed as the generalization of the seminal work by Baratin and Oriti: we have a (non-commutative) formulation of simplicial 3d gravity in the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant.

#### **Fermions on Quantum Geometry and Resolution of Doubling Problem**
 - **Authors:** Cong Zhang, Hongguang Liu, Muxin Han
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12208)
 - **Abstract**
 The fermion doubling problem has an important impact on quantum gravity, by revealing the tension between fermion and the fundamental discreteness of quantum spacetime. In this work, we discover that in Loop Quantum Gravity, the quantum geometry involving superposition of states associated with lattice refinements provides a resolution to the fermion doubling problem. We construct and analyze the fermion propagator on the quantum geometry, and we show that all fermion doubler modes are suppressed in the propagator. Our result suggests that the superposition nature of quantum geometry should resolve the tension between fermion and the fundamental discreteness, and relate to the continuum limit of quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Anomaly free quantum dynamics for Euclidean LQG**
 - **Authors:** Madhavan Varadarajan
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10779)
 - **Abstract**
 Classical gravitational evolution admits an elegant and compact re-expression in terms of gauge covariant generalizations of Lie derivatives with respect to a spatial phase space dependent $su(2)$ valued vector field called the Electric Shift [1]. A quantum dynamics for Euclidean Loop Quantum Gravity which ascribes a central role to the Electric Shift operator is derived in [2]. $Here\; we\; show\; that\; this \;quantum\; dynamics\; is\; nontrivially\; anomaly$ $free$. Specifically, we show that on a suitable space of off shell states (a) the (non-vanishing) commutator between a pair of Hamiltonian constraint operators mirrors the Poisson bracket between their classical correspondents, (b) the group of finite spatial diffeomorphisms is faithfully represented and (c) the action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is diffeomorphism covariant with respect to the action of spatial diffeomorphisms. 

#### **Spin network entanglement: coarse-graining**
 - **Authors:** Qian Chen
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11205](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11205)
 - **Abstract**
 In loop quantum gravity, partitioning graph introduces boundaries and entanglement between spin sub-networks, reflecting non-local degrees of freedom and correlation amongst spatial regions. This gives rise to the view of coarse-graining, reducing the degrees of freedom that are unnecessary to be considered. The present work sets coarse-graining in the framework of bulk-boundary relation. We investigates the spin network entanglement, showing that the entanglement is invariant under the coarse-graining at kinematical level. Moreover, we build the transformation between holonomy operators based on finer graph and coarser graph, and reveal the preservation of the coarse-graining method under the evolution generated by the holonomy operator. This leads to a holographical perspective for the entanglement issue in loop quantum gravity.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **The thermodynamics of isolated horizon in higher dimensional loop  quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Shupeng Song, Gaoping Long, Cong Zhang, Xiangdong Zhang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09984)
 - **Abstract**
 The statistical mechanical calculation of the thermodynamical properties of higher-dimensional non-rotating isolated horizons is studied in the loop quantum gravity framework. By employing the Hawking temperature and horizon mass of isolated horizons as physical input, the microcanonical ensemble associated with the system are well established. As a result, the black hole entropy and other thermodynamical quantities can be computed and consistent with well known Hawking's semiclassical analysis. Moreover, the value of the Immirzi parameter of higher-dimensional loop quantum gravity is also obtained.
