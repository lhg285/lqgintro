#### **Title:
          A class of entangled and diffeomorphism-invariant states in loop quantum gravity: Bell-network states**

 - **Abstract**
 Bell-network states constitute a class of diffeomorphism-invariant and entangled states of the geometry within loop quantum gravity (LQG) that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in the limit of large spins. The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory.

#### **Title:
          Effective dynamics of Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime**
 - **Authors:** Faqiang Yuan, Shengzhi Li, Zhen Li, Yongge Ma

 - **Abstract**
 The effective dynamics of the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime inspired by loop quantum gravity is studied. Two different schemes are considered to regularize the Hamiltonian constraint for the quantum dynamics. In the $\mu_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $\mu_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          Effective potential in $SO(N)$ symmetric scalar field theories in curved spacetime**
 - **Authors:** V.A. Filippov, R.M. Iakhibbaev, D. M. Tolkachev
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We derive recurrence relations for leading logarithmic all-loop quantum corrections in the case of $SO(N)$ symmetric scalar theory with an arbitrary potential in curved spacetime. On this basis, a system of renormalisation group (RG) equations in the general is obtained approach for the effective potential in the large $N$ limit. As a simple illustration, we analyse the case of power-like potentials in the Jordan frame and discuss their application to inflationary cosmology.
