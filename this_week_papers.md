 - **Abstract**
 In a torus compactification with magnetic flux, the scalar field generated from the higher dimensional gauge field becomes the Nambu-Goldstone boson of the translational symmetry in extra spaces and the mass of the scalar field is not allowed. In this paper, we explicitly show that the one-loop quantum correction to the mass of the scalar field is generated at fixed points in a case of an orbifold compactification $T^2/Z_2$ with magnetic flux. This is because the scalar field is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson as a result of explicit breaking of the translational symmetry by the fixed points. This result might be possible to shed a new light on the solution of the hierarchy problem.
