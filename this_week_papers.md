#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **A nonsingular spherically symmetric black-hole model with holonomy  corrections**
 - **Authors:** Asier Alonso-Bardaji, David Brizuela, Raül Vera
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02098)
 - **Abstract**
 We present a covariant model of a spherically symmetric black hole with corrections motivated by loop quantum gravity. The effective modifications, parametrized by a positive constant $\lambda$, are implemented through a canonical transformation and a linear combination of the constraints of general relativity, in such a way that the theory remains free of anomalies and general relativity is recovered for $\lambda=0$. In addition, the corresponding metric is constructed in a fully covariant way to ensure that gauge transformations on phase space correspond to coordinate changes. The solution for each gauge choice provides a chart and corresponding line element of a spacetime solution whose geometry is unambiguously determined in terms of the parameter $\lambda$ and a constant of motion $m$. For positive values of $m$, the solution is asymptotically flat and contains a globally hyperbolic black-hole/white-hole region with a minimal spacelike hypersurface that replaces the Schwarzschild singularity. The corresponding exterior regions are isometric and, in particular, allow the computation of the ADM mass. The procedure to obtain the global causal structure of the solution yields, also, its maximal analytic extension.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Space-like Singularities of General Relativity: A Phantom menace?**
 - **Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar, Adrián del Río, Marc Schneider
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00298](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00298)
 - **Abstract**
 The big bang and the Schwarzschild singularities are space-like. They are generally regarded as the "final frontiers" at which space-time ends and general relativity breaks down. We review the status of such space-like singularities from three increasingly more general perspectives. They are provided by (i) A reformulation of classical general relativity motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov, Lifshitz conjecture on the behavior of the gravitational field near space-like singularities; (ii) The use of test quantum fields to probe the nature of these singularities; and, (iii) An analysis of the fate of these singularities in loop quantum gravity due to quantum geometry effects. At all three levels singularities turn out to be less menacing than one might a priori expect from classical general relativity. Our goal is to present an overview of the emerging conceptual picture and suggest lines for further work. In line with the \emph{Introduction to Current Research} theme, we have made an attempt to make it easily accessible to all researchers in gravitational physics.
