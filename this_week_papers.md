 - **Abstract**
 We study the semi-classical limit of the recently proposed coherent spin foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. Specifically, we analyze the gluing equations derived from the stationary phase approximation of the vertex amplitude. Typically these exhibit two solutions yielding a cosine of the Regge action. However, by inspection of the algebraic equations as well as their geometrical realization, we show in this note that the behavior is more nuanced: when all triangles are either spacelike or timelike, two solutions exist. In any other case, only a single solution is obtained, thus yielding a single Regge exponential.
