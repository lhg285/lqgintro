#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **From loop quantum gravity to cosmology: the 2-vertex model**
 - **Authors:** Álvaro Cendal, Iñaki Garay, Luis J. Garay
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15320](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15320)
 - **Abstract**
 We show that the U(N)-symmetry reduction of the loop-quantum-gravity truncation known as the 2-vertex model provides the effective improved dynamics of loop quantum cosmology with an arbitrary perfect barotropic fluid content.
