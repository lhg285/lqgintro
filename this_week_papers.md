 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we attempt to construct a regular gravastar model using the UV corrected framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. We find that a stable gravastar model can be constructed with a number of unique features: (i) no thin shell approximation needs to be invoked to obtain solutions in the shell which can be considered to be of a finite thickness, (ii) the central singularity of a self gravitating object can be averted by a bounce mechanism, such that the interior density of the gravastar reaches a maximum critical density and cannot be raised further due to an operative repulsive force, (iii) the inherent isotropy of the effective fluid description does not prevent the formation of a stable gravastar and anisotropic pressures is not an essential requirement.
