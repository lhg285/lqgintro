#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Title:
          An Exactly Soluble Group Field Theory**
 - **Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Hassan Mehmood, Viqar Husain
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kuchař (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a corresponding spinfoam model developed earlier; we also show that the HK-GFT admits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of the HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.
