#### **Title:
          Origins of Thermalization in Semiclassical Cosmology**
 - **Authors:** Michael Osei
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the effect of accelerated frames in cosmology, and obtain origins of thermalization of the cosmic evolution of the semi-classical universe. We implement a transformation in super-space, and the WKB wave function defined on super space has a Bogoliubov transformation. In the transformed frame we find the density matrix which is mixed, and this is the sign of a thermal system. Whereas this result does not have the same interpretations of a particle thermalization in accelerated frames, one can show the super space transformation similar to a double Rindler transformation of real space-time coordinates. We also discuss the implications of the super-space transformation in loop quantum cosmology.

#### **Title:
          Quantization of Anisotropic Topological Yang Mills Theory**
 - **Authors:** Emil Albrychiewicz, Andrés Franco Valiente, Viola Zixin Zhao
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We continue our investigation into anisotropic topological field theories which arise from a tropical limit of conventional isotropic topological field theories. We analyze both the TBF theory and the tropical analogue of 2D topological Yang-Mills theory (TrYM) through a direct path integral calculation which probes a deformed analytic torsion and also through canonical quantization. The explicit construction of the Hilbert space of TrYM theory demonstrates that the TrYM theory provides an example of a solvable field theory where anisotropy properties and topological invariance can simultaneously hold. We show that the partition function has an asymptotic limit, which verifies that the dimension of the moduli space of tropicalized flat connection on a Riemann surface of genus $g>1$ is precisely given by $(g-1) \operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$. We conjecture that the large $N$ expansion of the associated matrix model of 2D TrYM is associated to the wedge region of nonequilibrium string theory.

#### **Title:
          Quantum induced shock dynamics in gravitational collapse: insights from effective models and numerical frameworks**
 - **Authors:** Hongguang Liu, Dongxue Qu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)
 - **Abstract**
 We explore the formation and evolution of shock waves in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse within a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) inspired effective framework. In this setting, the classical singularities are replaced by quantum-induced shell-crossing singularities, which are resolved through weak solutions such as shock waves. By formulating the dynamics in a generalized Painlevé--Gullstrand coordinate system, we derive a first-order partial differential equation that governs the propagation of the shock surface, while enforcing metric continuity via thin-shell junction conditions. To handle the non-trivial square-root structures and source terms that arise in these equations, we develop a novel numerical scheme capable of simulating quantum-corrected spacetime dynamics. Our results show that for small mass black holes near the Planck scale, the shock surface remains timelike and is shielded behind both inner and outer horizons. In the long-time limit, the shock accumulates the entire mass of the collapsing star. In contrast, for larger black hole masses, the shock surface develops spacelike segments, indicating a transition in the effective dynamics driven by quantum effects. The framework also reveals discontinuities in curvature invariants across the shock surface, which can be traced back to stress-energy redistributions caused by quantum effects. Overall, the proposed computational framework provides a general tool for modeling quantum-corrected gravitational collapse and offers new insights into black hole formations, singularity resolution, and the interplay between quantum geometry effects and effective spacetime structures.
