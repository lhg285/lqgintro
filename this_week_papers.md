 - **Abstract**
 We derive recurrence relations for leading logarithmic all-loop quantum corrections in the case of $SO(N)$ symmetric scalar theory with an arbitrary potential in curved spacetime. On this basis, a system of renormalisation group (RG) equations in the general is obtained approach for the effective potential in the large $N$ limit. As a simple illustration, we analyse the case of power-like potentials in the Jordan frame and discuss their application to inflationary cosmology.
