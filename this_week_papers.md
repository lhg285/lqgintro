#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Non-degenerate metrics, hypersurface deformation algebra, non-anomalous  representations and density weights in quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08299)
 - **Abstract**
 A basic assumption in classical GR is that the metric field is nowhere degenerate in spacetime. In particular the induced metric on Cauchy surfaces must be nowhere degenerate. It is only under this assumption that one can derive the hypersurace deformation algebra between the initial value constraints which is absolutely transparent from the fact that the {\it inverse} of the induced metric is needed to close the algebra. This statement is independent of the density weight that one may want to equip the spatial metric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation of the hypersurface defomation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the issue of non-degenracy of the induced metric that is needed in the classical theory. In the Hilbert space representation employed in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) most emphasis has been layed to define an inverse metric operator on the dense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum geometries which are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that demonstration of closure of the constraint algebra on this domain meets difficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically forbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical hypersurface deformation algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue such as non-standard operator topologies, dual spaces (habitats) and density weights have been propposed to address this issue with respect to the quantum dynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that insisting on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG representation may provide a natural resolution of the issue thereby possibly avoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions. 

#### **An open scattering model in polymerized quantum mechanics**
 - **Authors:** Kristina Giesel, Michael Kobler
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08749)
 - **Abstract**
 We derive a quantum master equation in the context of a polymerized open quantum mechanical system for the scattering of a Brownian particle in an ideal gas environment. The model is formulated in a top-down approach by choosing a Hamiltonian with a coupling between the system and environment that is generally associated with spatial decoherence. We extend the existing work on such models by using a non-standard representation of the canonical commutation relations, inspired by the quantization procedure applied in loop quantum gravity, which yields a model in which position operators are replaced by holonomies. The derivation of the master equation in a top-down approach opens up the possibility to investigate in detail whether the assumptions, usually used in such models in order to obtain a tractable form of the dissipator, hold also in the polymerized case or whether they need to be dropped or modified. Furthermore, we discuss some physical properties of the master equation associated to effective equations for the expectation values of the fundamental operators and compare our results to the already existing models of collisional decoherence.

#### **Exact quantisation of U(1)$^3$ quantum gravity via exponentiation of the  hypersurface deformation algebroid**
 - **Authors:** T. Thiemann
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08302)
 - **Abstract**
 The U(1)$^3$ model for 3+1 Euclidian signature general relativity is an interacting, generally covariant field theory with two physical polarisations that shares many features of Lorentzian general relativity. In particular, it displays a non-trivial realisation of the hypersurface deformation algebroid with non-trivial, i.e. phase space dependent structure functions rather than structure constants. In this paper we show that the model admits {\it an exact quantisation}. The quantisation rests on the observation that for this model and in the chosen representation of the canonical commutation relations the density unity hypersurface algebra {\it can be exponentiated on non-degenerate states}. These are states that represent a non-degenerate quantum metric and from a classical perspective are the relevant states on which the hypersurface algebra is representable. The representation of the algebra is exact, with no ambiguities involved and anomaly free. The quantum constraints can be exactly solved using {\it groupoid averaging} and the solutions admit a Hilbert space structure that agrees with the quantisation of a recently found reduced phase space formulation. Using the also recently found covariant action for that model, we start a path integral or spin foam formulation which, due to the Abelian character of the gauge group, is much simpler than for Lorentzian signature general relativity and provides an ideal testing ground for general spin foam models.
