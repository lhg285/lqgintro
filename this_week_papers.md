#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum measure as a necessary ingredient in quantum gravity and  modified gravities**
 - **Authors:** Vladimir Dzhunushaliev, Vladimir Folomeev
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17546)
 - **Abstract**
 We suggest commutation relations for a quantum measure. In one version of these relations, the right-hand side takes account of the presence of curvature of space; in the simplest case, this yields the action of general relativity. We consider the cases of the quantization of the measure on spaces of constant curvature and show that in this case the commutation relations for the quantum measure are analogues of commutation relations in loop quantum gravity. It is assumed that, in contrast to loop quantum gravity, a triangulation of space is a necessary trick for quantizing such a nonlocal quantity like a measure; in doing so, the space remains a smooth manifold. We consider the self-consistent problem of the interaction of the quantum measure and classical gravitation. It is shown that this inevitably leads to the appearance of modified gravities. Also, we consider the problem of defining the Euler-Lagrange equations for a matter field in the background of a space endowed with quantum measure. 

#### **Shadows and photon rings of a quantum black hole**
 - **Authors:** Jing-Peng Ye, Zhi-Qing He, Ai-Xu Zhou, Zi-Yang Huang, Jia-Hui Huang
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17724](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17724)
 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a black hole model in loop quantum gravity has been proposed by Lewandowski, Ma, Yang and Zhang (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{130}, 101501 (2023)). The metric tensor of the quantum black hole (QBH) is a suitably modified Schwarzschild one. In this paper, we calculate the radius of light ring and obtain the linear approximation of it with respect to the quantum correction parameter $\alpha$: $r_{l} \simeq 3 M - \frac{\alpha}{9 M}$. We then assume the QBH is backlit by a large, distant plane of uniform, isotropic emission and calculate the radius of the black hole shadow and its linear approximation: $r_{s} = 3 \sqrt{3} M - \frac{\alpha}{6 \left(\sqrt{3} M\right)}$. We also consider the photon ring structures in the shadow when the impact parameter $b$ of the photon approaches to a critical impact parameter $b_{\textrm{c}}$, and obtain a formula for estimating the deflection angle, which is $\varphi_{\textrm{def}} = - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\omega r_{l}^2}\log{\left(b - b_c\right) + \widetilde{C}(b)}$. We also numerically plot the images of shadows and photon rings of the QBH in three different illumination models and compare them with that of a Schwarzschild in each model. It is found that we could distinguish the quantum black hole with a Schwarzschild black hole by the shadow images in certain specific illumination model.
