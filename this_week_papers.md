 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the properties of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a regular black hole(BH) characterized by a Minkowski core and sub-Planckian curvature. When focusing on a special case, this regular BH exhibits identical large-scale behavior with the Hayward BH and some loop quantum gravity corrected (LQG-corrected) BH. A notable characteristic of the QNMs in this regular BH is the pronounced outburst of overtones when compared to the Schwarzschild BH (SS-BH). This outburst can be attributed to the deviation from the SS-BH in the near-horizon geometry region due to the quantum gravity effect. Furthermore, we compare the QNM properties of the regular BH with those of the Hayward BH and the LQG-corrected BH. A similar phenomenon of overtone outburst is observed in the modes of the overtone. As a conclusion, the QNMs may be a powerful tool for detecting the quantum gravity effect and distinguishing different BH models.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Effects of underlying topology on quantum state discrimination**
 - **Authors:** Aatif Kaisar Khan, Yasir Hassan Dar, Elias C. Vagenas, Salman Sajad Wani, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mir Faizal
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we show that quantum state discrimination can be modified due to a change in the underlying topology of a system. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that the quantum state discrimination of systems with underlying discrete topology differs from that of systems with underlying continuous topology. Such changes in the topology of a spacetime can occur in certain quantum gravity approaches. In fact, all approaches to quantum gravity can be classified into two types: those with underlying continuous topology (such as string theory) and those with an underlying discrete topology (such as loop quantum gravity). We demonstrate that the topology of these two types of quantum gravity approaches has different effects on the quantum state discrimination of low-energy quantum systems. We also show that any modification of quantum mechanics, which does not change the underlying topology, does not modify quantum state discrimination.
