#### **A Simple Model for Quantum Gravity: the one-dimensional case**
 - **Authors:** Ricardo Paszko
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08496)
 - **Abstract**
 Group theory is used to construct a model for quantum gravity and exact results are obtained in one dimension. Comparison with Regge calculus shows that the results agree in the strong cosmological constant limit for an open curve. In the closed case, the average edge length has a minimum value and this give us a clue for higher dimensions.

#### **$T\bar{T}$ in JT Gravity and BF Gauge Theory**
 - **Authors:** Stephen Ebert, Christian Ferko, Hao-Yu Sun, Zhengdi Sun
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07817](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07817)
 - **Abstract**
 JT gravity has a first-order formulation as a two-dimensional BF theory, which can be viewed as the dimensional reduction of the Chern-Simons description of 3d gravity. We consider $T\bar{T}$-type deformations of the $(0+1)$-dimensional dual to this $2d$ BF theory and interpret the deformation as a modification of the BF theory boundary conditions. The fundamental observables in this deformed BF theory, and in its $3d$ Chern-Simons lift, are Wilson lines and loops. In the $3d$ Chern-Simons setting, we study modifications to correlators involving boundary-anchored Wilson lines which are induced by a $T\bar{T}$ deformation on the $2d$ boundary; results are presented at both the classical level (using modified boundary conditions) and the quantum-mechanical level (using conformal perturbation theory). Finally, we calculate the analogous deformed Wilson line correlators in $2d$ BF theory below the Hagedorn temperature where the principal series dominates over the discrete series.
