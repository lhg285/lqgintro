#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Research on the application of loop quantum theory model in black hole  quantum information**
 - **Authors:** Yangting Liu
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15435)
 - **Abstract**
 An important reason why it is currently difficult to unify relativity theory and quantum theory is the quantum information paradox. The information engulfment pointed out by general relativity violates the principles of quantum mechanics. An important reason why the industry does not have a clear understanding of this phenomenon is the current lack of a theoretically solvable cosmological model. Based on the complete model of loop quantum theory, this article solves different levels of Hamiltonian constraint models and simulates black hole information transfer dynamics, especially at extreme points, from analytical results to step-by-step quantum corrections, and attempts to compare the performance of different physical models in simulating quantum Advantages during information transmission. Our study shows that even second-order expansions are sufficient to distinguish differences in dynamics at the black hole extremes, but to truly identify a model that has the potential to describe quantum information transfer mechanisms and is significantly different from other models, the theoretical analytical solution should at least extend to Level three and above. In addition, the research results such as computational simulation methods and related conclusions cited and improved in this article can provide certain theoretical support and new insights for the research prospects of general relativity loop quantum cosmology and the intersection of quantum information and quantum fields.

#### **Hamiltonian analysis and Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for two-Dimensional  Quadratic Gravity expressed as BF theory**
 - **Authors:** Jaime Manuel Cabrera, Jorge Mauricio Paulin Fuentes
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15494)
 - **Abstract**
 We examine the model of Two-Dimensional Quadratic Gravity as a consequence of symmetry breaking within the framework of background field (BF) theory. This theory is essentially an extension of BF theory, introducing an additional polynomial term that operates on both the gauge and background fields. We analyze the theory using the Dirac and Faddeev-Jackiw procedures, determining the form of the gauge transformation, the full structure of the constraints, the counting of degrees of freedom, and the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets. Additionally, we demonstrate the coincidence of the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac's brackets. Finally, we provide some remarks and discuss prospects.

#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Quantum hair and entropy for slowly rotating quantum black holes**
 - **Authors:** Wenbin Feng, Roldao da Rocha, Roberto Casadio
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14540)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the quantum hair associated with coherent states describing slowly rotating black holes and show how it can be naturally related with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and with 1-loop quantum corrections of the metric for the (effectively) non-rotating case. We also estimate corrections induced by such quantum hair to the temperature of the Hawking radiation through the tunnelling method. 

#### **Inequivalence of mimetic gravity with models of loop quantum gravity**
 - **Authors:** Martin Bojowald, Erick I. Duque
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15040)
 - **Abstract**
 Certain versions of mimetic gravity have recently been claimed to present potential covariant theories of canonically modified spherically symmetric gravity, motivated by ingredients from loop quantum gravity. If such an equivalence were to hold, it would demonstrate general covariance of a large class of models considered in loop quantum gravity. However, the relationship with mimetic gravity as presented so far is incomplete because it has been proposed only in preferred space-time slicings of uniform scalar fields. Here, several independent arguments are used to show that neither an equivalence nor a covariance claim are correct for models of loop quantum gravity. The framework of emergent modified gravity is found to present a broad setting in which such questions can be analyzed efficiently. As an additional result, the discussion sheds light on the co-existence of different and mutually inequivalent approaches to an implementation of the gravitational dynamics within loop quantum gravity.

#### **Deficit Angles in 4D Spinfoam with Cosmological Constant: (Anti) de  Sitter-ness and More**
 - **Authors:** Muxin Han, Qiaoyin Pan
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14643)
 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the critical behaviors of the 4-dimensional spinfoam model with cosmological constant for a general 4-dimensional simplicial complex as the discretization of spacetime. We find that, at the semi-classical regime, the spinfoam amplitude is peaked at the real critical points that correspond to zero deficit angles (modulo $4\pi\mathbb{Z}/\gamma$) hinged by internal triangles of the 4-complex. Since the 4-simplices from the model are of constant curvature, the discrete geometry with zero deficit angle manifests a de Sitter (dS) spacetime or an anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetime depending on the sign of the cosmological constant fixed by the boundary condition. The non-(A)dS spacetimes emerge from the complex critical points by an analytic continuation to complex configurations.
