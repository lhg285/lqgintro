#### Loop quantum gravity related papers

#### **Emergent Cosmology from Quantum Gravity in the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane  Tensorial Group Field Theory Model**
 - **Authors:** Alexander F. Jercher, Daniele Oriti, Andreas G. A. Pithis
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00091](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00091)
 - **Abstract**
 We study the cosmological sector of the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane (BC) model coupled to a free massless scalar field in its Group Field Theory (GFT) formulation, corresponding to the mean-field hydrodynamics obtained from coherent condensate states. The relational evolution of the condensate with respect to the scalar field yields effective dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies, similar to those previously obtained in $\text{SU}(2)$-based EPRL-like models. Also in this manifestly Lorentzian setting, in which only continuous $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-representations are used, we obtain generalized Friedmann equations that generically exhibit a quantum bounce, and can reproduce all of the features of the cosmological dynamics of EPRL-like models. This lends support to the expectation that the EPRL-like and BC models may lie in the same continuum universality class, and that the quantum gravity mechanism producing effective bouncing scenarios may not depend directly on the discretization of geometric observables.

#### **Spinor Representation of the Hamiltonian Constraint in 3D LQG with a  Non-zero Cosmological Constant**
 - **Authors:** Valentin Bonzom, Maïté Dupuis, Qiaoyin Pan
 - **Subjects:** General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14471)
 - **Abstract**
 We develop in a companion article the kinematics of three-dimensional loop quantum gravity in Euclidean signature and with a negative cosmological constant, focusing in particular on the spinorial representation which is well-known at zero cosmological constant. In this article, we put this formalism to the test by quantizing the Hamiltonian constraint on the dual of a triangulation. The Hamiltonian constraints are obtained by projecting the flatness constraints onto spinors, as done in the flat case by the first author and Livine. Quantization then relies on $q$-deformed spinors. The quantum Hamiltonian constraint acts in the $q$-deformed spin network basis as difference equations on physical states, which are thus the Wheeler-DeWitt equations in this framework. Moreover, we study how physical states transform under Pachner moves of the canonical surface. We find that those transformations are in fact $q$-deformations of the transition amplitudes of the flat case as found by Noui and Perez. Our quantum Hamiltonian constraints therefore build a Turaev-Viro model at real $q$. 

#### **Spin Networks, Wilson Loops and 3nj Wigner Identities**
 - **Authors:** Manu Mathur, Atul Rathor
 - **Subjects:** Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14685)
 - **Abstract**
 We exploit the spin network properties of the magnetic eigenstates of SU(2) Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and use the Wilson loop operators to obtain a wide class of new identities amongst 3nj Wigner coefficients. We also show that the topological ground states of the SU(2) toric code Hamiltonian lead to Wigner 3nj identities with non-trivial phases. The method is very general and involves only the eigenvalue equations of any gauge invariant operator and their solutions. Therefore, it can be extended to any higher dimensional spin networks as well as larger SU(N) groups.
